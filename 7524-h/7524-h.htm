    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Very little is known concerning the life of Tacitus, the historian, except
      that which he tells us in his own writings and those incidents which are
      related of him by his contemporary, Pliny.
    </p>
    <p>
      His full name was Caius Cornelius Tacitus. The date of his birth can only
      be arrived at by conjecture, and then only approximately. The younger
      Pliny speaks of him as <i>prope modum aequales</i>, about the same age.
      Pliny was born in 61. Tacitus, however, occupied the office of quaestor
      under Vespasian in 78 A.D., at which time he must, therefore, have been at
      least twenty-five years of age. This would fix the date of his birth not
      later than 53 A.D. It is probable, therefore, that Tacitus was Pliny's
      senior by several years.
    </p>
    <p>
      His parentage is also a matter of pure conjecture. The name Cornelius was
      a common one among the Romans, so that from it we can draw no inference.
      The fact that at an early age he occupied a prominent public office
      indicates that he was born of good family, and it is not impossible that
      his father was a certain Cornelius Tacitus, a Roman knight, who was
      procurator in Belgic Gaul, and whom the elder Pliny speaks of in his
      "Natural History."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the early life of Tacitus and the training which he underwent
      preparatory to those literary efforts which afterwards rendered him a
      conspicuous figure among Roman literateurs we know absolutely nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the events of his life which transpired after he attained man's estate
      we know but little beyond that which he himself has recorded in his
      writings. He occupied a position of some eminence as a pleader at the
      Roman bar, and in 77 A.D. married the daughter of Julius Agricola, a
      humane and honorable citizen, who was at that time consul and was
      subsequently appointed governor of Britain. It is quite possible that this
      very advantageous alliance hastened his promotion to the office of
      quaestor under Vespasian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Domitian, in 88, Tacitus was appointed one of fifteen commissioners
      to preside at the celebration of the secular games. In the same year he
      held the office of praetor, and was a member of one of the most select of
      the old priestly colleges, in which a pre-requisite of membership was that
      a man should be born of a good family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following year he appears to have left Rome, and it is possible that
      he visited Germany and there obtained his knowledge and information
      respecting the manners and customs of its people which he makes the
      subject of his work known as the "Germany."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not return to Rome until 93, after an absence of four years, during
      which time his father-in-law died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time between the years 93 and 97 he was elected to the senate, and
      during this time witnessed the judicial murders of many of Rome's best
      citizens which were perpetrated under the reign of Nero. Being himself a
      senator, he felt that he was not entirely guiltless of the crimes which
      were committed, and in his "Agricola" we find him giving expression to
      this feeling in the following words: "Our own hands dragged Helvidius to
      prison; ourselves were tortured with the spectacle of Mauricus and
      Rusticus, and sprinkled with the innocent blood of Senecio."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 97 he was elected to the consulship as successor to Virginius Rufus,
      who died during his term of office and at whose funeral Tacitus delivered
      an oration in such a manner to cause Pliny to say, "The good fortune of
      Virginius was crowned by having the most eloquent of panegyrists."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 99 Tacitus was appointed by the senate, together with Pliny, to conduct
      the prosecution against a great political offender, Marius Priscus, who,
      as proconsul of Africa, had corruptly mismanaged the affairs of his
      province. We have his associate's testimony that Tacitus made a most
      eloquent and dignified reply to the arguments which were urged on the part
      of the defence. The prosecution was successful, and both Pliny and Tacitus
      were awarded a vote of thanks by the senate for their eminent and
      effectual efforts in the management of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exact date of Tacitus's death is not known, but in his "Annals" he
      seems to hint at the successful extension of the Emperor Trajan's eastern
      campaigns during the years 115 to 117, so that it is probable that he
      lived until the year 117.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tacitus had a widespread reputation during his lifetime. On one occasion
      it is related of him that as he sat in the circus at the celebration of
      some games, a Roman knight asked him whether he was from Italy or the
      provinces. Tacitus answered, "You know me from your reading," to which the
      knight quickly replied, "Are you then Tacitus or Pliny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also worthy of notice that the Emperor Marcus Claudius Tacitus, who
      reigned during the third century, claimed to be descended from the
      historian, and directed that ten copies of his works should be published
      every year and placed in the public libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list of the extant works of Tacitus is as follows: the "Germany;" the
      "Life of Agricola;" the "Dialogue on Orators;" the "Histories," and the
      "Annals."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following pages contain translations of the first two of these works.
      The "Germany," the full title of which is "Concerning the situation,
      manners and inhabitants of Germany," contains little of value from a
      historical standpoint. It describes with vividness the fierce and
      independent spirit of the German nations, with many suggestions as to the
      dangers in which the empire stood of these people. The "Agricola" is a
      biographical sketch of the writer's father-in-law, who, as has been said,
      was a distinguished man and governor of Britain. It is one of the author's
      earliest works and was probably written shortly after the death of
      Domitian, in 96. This work, short as it is, has always been considered an
      admirable specimen of biography on account of its grace and dignity of
      expression. Whatever else it may be, it is a graceful and affectionate
      tribute to an upright and excellent man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Dialogue on Orators" treats of the decay of eloquence under the
      empire. It is in the form of a dialogue, and represents two eminent
      members of the Roman bar discussing the change for the worse that had
      taken place in the early education of the Roman youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Histories" relate the events which transpired in Rome, beginning with
      the ascession of Galba, in 68, and ending with the reign of Domitian, in
      97. Only four books and a fragment of a fifth have been preserved to us.
      These books contain an account of the brief reigns of Galba, Otho and
      Vitellius. The portion of the fifth book which has been preserved contains
      an interesting, though rather biased, account of the character, customs
      and religion of the Jewish nation viewed from the standpoint of a
      cultivated citizen of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Annals" contain the history of the empire from the death of Augustus,
      in 14, to the death of Nero, in 68, and originally consisted of sixteen
      books. Of these, only nine have come down to us in a state of entire
      preservation, and of the other seven we have but fragments of three. Out
      of a period of fifty-four years we have the history of about forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The style of Tacitus is, perhaps, noted principally for its conciseness.
      Tacitean brevity is proverbial, and many of his sentences are so brief,
      and leave so much for the student to read between the lines, that in order
      to be understood and appreciated the author must be read over and over
      again, lest the reader miss the point of some of his most excellent
      thoughts. Such an author presents grave, if not insuperable, difficulties
      to the translator, but notwithstanding this fact, the following pages
      cannot but impress the reader with the genius of Tacitus.

    <p>
      1. Germany <a href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a>
      is separated from Gaul, Rhaetia, <a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3"
      id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a> and Pannonia, <a href="#linknote-4"
      name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a> by the rivers
      Rhine and Danube; from Sarmatia and Dacia, by mountains <a
      href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5"><small>5</small></a>
      and mutual dread. The rest is surrounded by an ocean, embracing broad
      promontories <a href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a>
      and vast insular tracts, <a href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7"
      id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a> in which our military expeditions
      have lately discovered various nations and kingdoms. The Rhine, issuing
      from the inaccessible and precipitous summit of the Rhaetic Alps, <a
      href="#linknote-8" name="linknoteref-8" id="linknoteref-8"><small>8</small></a>
      bends gently to the west, and falls into the Northern Ocean. The Danube,
      poured from the easy and gently raised ridge of Mount Abnoba, <a
      href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9"><small>9</small></a>
      visits several nations in its course, till at length it bursts out <a
      href="#linknote-10" name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
      by six channels <a href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11"
      id="linknoteref-11"><small>11</small></a> into the Pontic sea; a seventh
      is lost in marshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The people of Germany appear to me indigenous, <a href="#linknote-12"
      name="linknoteref-12" id="linknoteref-12"><small>12</small></a> and free
      from intermixture with foreigners, either as settlers or casual visitants.
      For the emigrants of former ages performed their expeditions not by land,
      but by water; <a href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13"
      id="linknoteref-13"><small>13</small></a> and that immense, and, if I may
      so call it, hostile ocean, is rarely navigated by ships from our world. <a
      href="#linknote-14" name="linknoteref-14" id="linknoteref-14"><small>14</small></a>
      Then, besides the danger of a boisterous and unknown sea, who would
      relinquish Asia, Africa, or Italy, for Germany, a land rude in its
      surface, rigorous in its climate, cheerless to every beholder and
      cultivator, except a native? In their ancient songs, <a href="#linknote-15"
      name="linknoteref-15" id="linknoteref-15"><small>15</small></a> which are
      their only records or annals, they celebrate the god Tuisto, <a
      href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16" id="linknoteref-16"><small>16</small></a>
      sprung from the earth, and his son Mannus, as the fathers and founders of
      their race. To Mannus they ascribe three sons, from whose names <a
      href="#linknote-17" name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17"><small>17</small></a>
      the people bordering on the ocean are called Ingaevones; those inhabiting
      the central parts, Herminones; the rest, Istaevones. Some, <a
      href="#linknote-18" name="linknoteref-18" id="linknoteref-18"><small>18</small></a>
      however, assuming the licence of antiquity, affirm that there were more
      descendants of the god, from whom more appellations were derived; as those
      of the Marsi, <a href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19"
      id="linknoteref-19"><small>19</small></a> Gambrivii, <a href="#linknote-20"
      name="linknoteref-20" id="linknoteref-20"><small>20</small></a> Suevi, <a
      href="#linknote-21" name="linknoteref-21" id="linknoteref-21"><small>21</small></a>
      and Vandali; <a href="#linknote-22" name="linknoteref-22"
      id="linknoteref-22"><small>22</small></a> and that these are the genuine
      and original names. <a href="#linknote-23" name="linknoteref-23"
      id="linknoteref-23"><small>23</small></a> That of Germany, on the other
      hand, they assert to be a modern addition; <a href="#linknote-24"
      name="linknoteref-24" id="linknoteref-24"><small>24</small></a> for that
      the people who first crossed the Rhine, and expelled the Gauls, and are
      now called Tungri, were then named Germans; which appellation of a
      particular tribe, not of a whole people, gradually prevailed; so that the
      title of Germans, first assumed by the victors in order to excite terror,
      was afterwards adopted by the nation in general. <a href="#linknote-25"
      name="linknoteref-25" id="linknoteref-25"><small>25</small></a> They have
      likewise the tradition of a Hercules <a href="#linknote-26"
      name="linknoteref-26" id="linknoteref-26"><small>26</small></a> of their
      country, whose praises they sing before those of all other heroes as they
      advance to battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. A peculiar kind of verses is also current among them, by the recital of
      which, termed "barding," <a href="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27"
      id="linknoteref-27"><small>27</small></a> they stimulate their courage;
      while the sound itself serves as an augury of the event of the impending
      combat. For, according to the nature of the cry proceeding from the line,
      terror is inspired or felt: nor does it seem so much an articulate song,
      as the wild chorus of valor. A harsh, piercing note, and a broken roar,
      are the favorite tones; which they render more full and sonorous by
      applying their mouths to their shields. <a href="#linknote-28"
      name="linknoteref-28" id="linknoteref-28"><small>28</small></a> Some
      conjecture that Ulysses, in the course of his long and fabulous
      wanderings, was driven into this ocean, and landed in Germany; and that
      Asciburgium, <a href="#linknote-29" name="linknoteref-29"
      id="linknoteref-29"><small>29</small></a> a place situated on the Rhine,
      and at this day inhabited, was founded by him, and named <i>Askipurgion</i>.
      They pretend that an altar was formerly discovered here, consecrated to
      Ulysses, with the name of his father Laertes subjoined; and that certain
      monuments and tombs, inscribed with Greek characters, <a
      href="#linknote-30" name="linknoteref-30" id="linknoteref-30"><small>30</small></a>
      are still extant upon the confines of Germany and Rhaetia. These
      allegations I shall neither attempt to confirm nor to refute: let every
      one believe concerning them as he is disposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. I concur in opinion with those who deem the Germans never to have
      intermarried with other nations; but to be a race, pure, unmixed, and
      stamped with a distinct character. Hence a family likeness pervades the
      whole, though their numbers are so great: eyes stern and blue; ruddy hair;
      large bodies, <a href="#linknote-31" name="linknoteref-31"
      id="linknoteref-31"><small>31</small></a> powerful in sudden exertions,
      but impatient of toil and labor, least of all capable of sustaining thirst
      and heat. Cold and hunger they are accustomed by their climate and soil to
      endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The land, though varied to a considerable extent in its aspect, is yet
      universally shagged with forests, or deformed by marshes: moister on the
      side of Gaul, more bleak on the side of Norieum and Pannonia. <a
      href="#linknote-32" name="linknoteref-32" id="linknoteref-32"><small>32</small></a>
      It is productive of grain, but unkindly to fruit-trees. <a
      href="#linknote-33" name="linknoteref-33" id="linknoteref-33"><small>33</small></a>
      It abounds in flocks and herds, but in general of a small breed. Even the
      beeve kind are destitute of their usual stateliness and dignity of head:
      <a href="#linknote-34" name="linknoteref-34" id="linknoteref-34"><small>34</small></a>
      they are, however, numerous, and form the most esteemed, and, indeed, the
      only species of wealth. Silver and gold the gods, I know not whether in
      their favor or anger, have denied to this country. <a href="#linknote-35"
      name="linknoteref-35" id="linknoteref-35"><small>35</small></a> Not that I
      would assert that no veins of these metals are generated in Germany; for
      who has made the search? The possession of them is not coveted by these
      people as it is by us. Vessels of silver are indeed to be seen among them,
      which have been presented to their ambassadors and chiefs; but they are
      held in no higher estimation than earthenware. The borderers, however, set
      a value on gold and silver for the purpose of commerce, and have learned
      to distinguish several kinds of our coin, some of which they prefer to
      others: the remoter inhabitants continue the more simple and ancient usage
      of bartering commodities. The money preferred by the Germans is the old
      and well-known species, such as the <i>Serrati</i> and <i>Bigati</i>. <a
      href="#linknote-36" name="linknoteref-36" id="linknoteref-36"><small>36</small></a>
      They are also better pleased with silver than gold; <a href="#linknote-37"
      name="linknoteref-37" id="linknoteref-37"><small>37</small></a> not on
      account of any fondness for that metal, but because the smaller money is
      more convenient in their common and petty merchandise.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Even iron is not plentiful <a href="#linknote-38" name="linknoteref-38"
      id="linknoteref-38"><small>38</small></a> among them; as may be inferred
      from the nature of their weapons. Swords or broad lances are seldom used;
      but they generally carry a spear, (called in their language <i>framea</i>,
      <a href="#linknote-39" name="linknoteref-39" id="linknoteref-39"><small>39</small></a>)
      which has an iron blade, short and narrow, but so sharp and manageable,
      that, as occasion requires, they employ it either in close or distant
      fighting. <a href="#linknote-40" name="linknoteref-40" id="linknoteref-40"><small>40</small></a>
      This spear and a shield are all the armor of the cavalry. The foot have,
      besides, missile weapons, several to each man, which they hurl to an
      immense distance. <a href="#linknote-41" name="linknoteref-41"
      id="linknoteref-41"><small>41</small></a> They are either naked, <a
      href="#linknote-42" name="linknoteref-42" id="linknoteref-42"><small>42</small></a>
      or lightly covered with a small mantle; and have no pride in equipage:
      their shields only are ornamented with the choicest colors. <a
      href="#linknote-43" name="linknoteref-43" id="linknoteref-43"><small>43</small></a>
      Few are provided with a coat of mail; <a href="#linknote-44"
      name="linknoteref-44" id="linknoteref-44"><small>44</small></a> and
      scarcely here and there one with a casque or helmet.
<a href="#linknote-45" name="linknoteref-45" id="linknoteref-45"><small>45</small></a>
      Their horses are
      neither remarkable for beauty nor swiftness, nor are they taught the
      various evolutions practised with us. The cavalry either bear down
      straight forwards, or wheel once to the right, in so compact a body that
      none is left behind the rest. Their principal strength, on the whole,
      consists in their infantry: hence in an engagement these are intermixed
      with the cavalry; <a href="#linknote-46" name="linknoteref-46"
      id="linknoteref-46"><small>46</small></a> so Well accordant with the
      nature of equestrian combats is the agility of those foot soldiers, whom
      they select from the whole body of their youth, and place in the front of
      the line. Their number, too, is determined; a hundred from each canton: <a
      href="#linknote-47" name="linknoteref-47" id="linknoteref-47"><small>47</small></a>
      and they are distinguished at home by a name expressive of this
      circumstance; so that what at first was only an appellation of number,
      becomes thenceforth a title of honor. Their line of battle is disposed in
      wedges. <a href="#linknote-48" name="linknoteref-48" id="linknoteref-48"><small>48</small></a>
      To give ground, provided they rally again, is considered rather as a
      prudent strategem, than cowardice. They carry off their slain even while
      the battle remains undecided. The greatest disgrace that can befall them
      is to have abandoned their shields. <a href="#linknote-49"
      name="linknoteref-49" id="linknoteref-49"><small>49</small></a> A person
      branded with this ignominy is not permitted to join in their religious
      rites, or enter their assemblies; so that many, after escaping from
      battle, have put an end to their infamy by the halter.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. In the election of kings they have regard to birth; in that of
      generals, <a href="#linknote-50" name="linknoteref-50" id="linknoteref-50"><small>50</small></a>
      to valor. Their kings have not an absolute or unlimited power; <a
      href="#linknote-51" name="linknoteref-51" id="linknoteref-51"><small>51</small></a>
      and their generals command less through the force of authority, than of
      example. If they are daring, adventurous, and conspicuous in action, they
      procure obedience from the admiration they inspire. None, however, but the
      priests <a href="#linknote-52" name="linknoteref-52" id="linknoteref-52"><small>52</small></a>
      are permitted to judge offenders, to inflict bonds or stripes; so that
      chastisement appears not as an act of military discipline, but as the
      instigation of the god whom they suppose present with warriors. They also
      carry with them to battle certain images and standards taken from the
      sacred groves. <a href="#linknote-53" name="linknoteref-53"
      id="linknoteref-53"><small>53</small></a> It is a principal incentive to
      their courage, that their squadrons and battalions are not formed by men
      fortuitously collected, but by the assemblage of families and clans. Their
      pledges also are near at hand; they have within hearing the yells of their
      women, and the cries of their children. These, too, are the most revered
      witnesses of each man's conduct, these his most liberal applauders. To
      their mothers and their wives they bring their wounds for relief, nor do
      these dread to count or to search out the gashes. The women also
      administer food and encouragement to those who are fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Tradition relates, that armies beginning to give way have been rallied
      by the females, through the earnestness of their supplications, the
      interposition of their bodies, <a href="#linknote-54" name="linknoteref-54"
      id="linknoteref-54"><small>54</small></a> and the pictures they have drawn
      of impending slavery, <a href="#linknote-55" name="linknoteref-55"
      id="linknoteref-55"><small>55</small></a> a calamity which these people
      bear with more impatience for their women than themselves; so that those
      states who have been obliged to give among their hostages the daughters of
      noble families, are the most effectually bound to fidelity. <a
      href="#linknote-56" name="linknoteref-56" id="linknoteref-56"><small>56</small></a>
      They even suppose somewhat of sanctity and prescience to be inherent in
      the female sex; and therefore neither despise their counsels, <a
      href="#linknote-57" name="linknoteref-57" id="linknoteref-57"><small>57</small></a>
      nor disregard their responses. <a href="#linknote-58" name="linknoteref-58"
      id="linknoteref-58"><small>58</small></a> We have beheld, in the reign of
      Vespasian, Veleda, <a href="#linknote-59" name="linknoteref-59"
      id="linknoteref-59"><small>59</small></a> long reverenced by many as a
      deity. Aurima, moreover, and several others, <a href="#linknote-60"
      name="linknoteref-60" id="linknoteref-60"><small>60</small></a> were
      formerly held in equal veneration, but not with a servile flattery, nor as
      though they made them goddesses. <a href="#linknote-61"
      name="linknoteref-61" id="linknoteref-61"><small>61</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Of the gods, Mercury <a href="#linknote-62" name="linknoteref-62"
      id="linknoteref-62"><small>62</small></a> is the principal object of their
      adoration; whom, on certain days, <a href="#linknote-63"
      name="linknoteref-63" id="linknoteref-63"><small>63</small></a> they think
      it lawful to propitiate even with human victims. To Hercules and Mars <a
      href="#linknote-64" name="linknoteref-64" id="linknoteref-64"><small>64</small></a>
      they offer the animals usually allotted for sacrifice. <a
      href="#linknote-65" name="linknoteref-65" id="linknoteref-65"><small>65</small></a>
      Some of the Suevi also perform sacred rites to Isis. What was the cause
      and origin of this foreign worship, I have not been able to discover;
      further than that her being represented with the symbol of a galley, seems
      to indicate an imported religion. <a href="#linknote-66"
      name="linknoteref-66" id="linknoteref-66"><small>66</small></a> They
      conceive it unworthy the grandeur of celestial beings to confine their
      deities within walls, or to represent them under a human similitude: <a
      href="#linknote-67" name="linknoteref-67" id="linknoteref-67"><small>67</small></a>
      woods and groves are their temples; and they affix names of divinity to
      that secret power, which they behold with the eye of adoration alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. No people are more addicted to divination by omens and lots. The
      latter is performed in the following simple manner. They cut a twig <a
      href="#linknote-68" name="linknoteref-68" id="linknoteref-68"><small>68</small></a>
      from a fruit-tree, and divide it into small pieces, which, distinguished
      by certain marks, are thrown promiscuously upon a white garment. Then, the
      priest of the canton, if the occasion be public; if private, the master of
      the family; after an invocation of the gods, with his eyes lifted up to
      heaven, thrice takes out each piece, and, as they come up, interprets
      their signification according to the marks fixed upon them. If the result
      prove unfavorable, there is no more consultation on the same affair that
      day; if propitious, a confirmation by omens is still required. In common
      with other nations, the Germans are acquainted with the practice of
      auguring from the notes and flight of birds; but it is peculiar to them to
      derive admonitions and presages from horses also. <a href="#linknote-69"
      name="linknoteref-69" id="linknoteref-69"><small>69</small></a> Certain of
      these animals, milk-white, and untouched by earthly labor, are pastured at
      the public expense in the sacred woods and groves. These, yoked to a
      consecrated chariot, are accompanied by the priest, and king, or chief
      person of the community, who attentively observe their manner of neighing
      and snorting; and no kind of augury is more credited, not only among the
      populace, but among the nobles and priests. For the latter consider
      themselves as the ministers of the gods, and the horses, as privy to the
      divine will. Another kind of divination, by which they explore the event
      of momentous wars, is to oblige a prisoner, taken by any means whatsoever
      from the nation with whom they are at variance, to fight with a picked man
      of their own, each with his own country's arms; and, according as the
      victory falls, they presage success to the one or to the other party. <a
      href="#linknote-70" name="linknoteref-70" id="linknoteref-70"><small>70</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      11. On affairs of smaller moment, the chiefs consult; on those of greater
      importance, the whole community; yet with this circumstance, that what is
      referred to the decision of the people, is first maturely discussed by the
      chiefs. <a href="#linknote-71" name="linknoteref-71" id="linknoteref-71"><small>71</small></a>
      They assemble, unless upon some sudden emergency, on stated days, either
      at the new or full moon, which they account the most auspicious season for
      beginning any enterprise. Nor do they, in their computation of time,
      reckon, like us, by the number of days, but of nights. In this way they
      arrange their business; in this way they fix their appointments; so that,
      with them, the night seems to lead the day. <a href="#linknote-72"
      name="linknoteref-72" id="linknoteref-72"><small>72</small></a> An
      inconvenience produced by their liberty is, that they do not all assemble
      at a stated time, as if it were in obedience to a command; but two or
      three days are lost in the delays of convening. When they all think fit,
      <a href="#linknote-73" name="linknoteref-73" id="linknoteref-73"><small>73</small></a>
      they sit down armed. <a href="#linknote-74" name="linknoteref-74"
      id="linknoteref-74"><small>74</small></a> Silence is proclaimed by the
      priests, who have on this occasion a coercive power. Then the king, or
      chief, and such others as are conspicuous for age, birth, military renown,
      or eloquence, are heard; and gain attention rather from their ability to
      persuade, than their authority to command. If a proposal displease, the
      assembly reject it by an inarticulate murmur; if it prove agreeable, they
      clash their javelins; <a href="#linknote-75" name="linknoteref-75"
      id="linknoteref-75"><small>75</small></a> for the most honorable
      expression of assent among them is the sound of arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Before this council, it is likewise allowed to exhibit accusations,
      and to prosecute capital offences. Punishments are varied according to the
      nature of the crime. Traitors and deserters are hung upon trees: <a
      href="#linknote-76" name="linknoteref-76" id="linknoteref-76"><small>76</small></a>
      cowards, dastards, <a href="#linknote-77" name="linknoteref-77"
      id="linknoteref-77"><small>77</small></a> and those guilty of unnatural
      practices, <a href="#linknote-78" name="linknoteref-78" id="linknoteref-78"><small>78</small></a>
      are suffocated in mud under a hurdle. <a href="#linknote-79"
      name="linknoteref-79" id="linknoteref-79"><small>79</small></a> This
      difference of punishment has in view the principle, that villainy should
      be exposed while it is punished, but turpitude concealed. The penalties
      annexed to slighter offences <a href="#linknote-80" name="linknoteref-80"
      id="linknoteref-80"><small>80</small></a> are also proportioned to the
      delinquency. The convicts are fined in horses and cattle: <a
      href="#linknote-81" name="linknoteref-81" id="linknoteref-81"><small>81</small></a>
      part of the mulct <a href="#linknote-82" name="linknoteref-82"
      id="linknoteref-82"><small>82</small></a> goes to the king or state; part
      to the injured person, or his relations. In the same assemblies chiefs <a
      href="#linknote-83" name="linknoteref-83" id="linknoteref-83"><small>83</small></a>
      are also elected, to administer justice through the cantons and districts.
      A hundred companions, chosen from the people, attended upon each of them,
      to assist them as well with their advice as their authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The Germans transact no business, public or private, without being
      armed: <a href="#linknote-84" name="linknoteref-84" id="linknoteref-84"><small>84</small></a>
      but it is not customary for any person to assume arms till the state has
      approved his ability to use them. Then, in the midst of the assembly,
      either one of the chiefs, or the father, or a relation, equips the youth
      with a shield and javelin. <a href="#linknote-85" name="linknoteref-85"
      id="linknoteref-85"><small>85</small></a> These are to them the manly
      gown; <a href="#linknote-86" name="linknoteref-86" id="linknoteref-86"><small>86</small></a>
      this is the first honor conferred on youth: before this they are
      considered as part of a household; afterwards, of the state. The dignity
      of chieftain is bestowed even on mere lads, whose descent is eminently
      illustrious, or whose fathers have performed signal services to the
      public; they are associated, however, with those of mature strength, who
      have already been declared capable of service; nor do they blush to be
      seen in the rank of companions. <a href="#linknote-87"
      name="linknoteref-87" id="linknoteref-87"><small>87</small></a> For the
      state of companionship itself has its several degrees, determined by the
      judgment of him whom they follow; and there is a great emulation among the
      companions, which shall possess the highest place in the favor of their
      chief; and among the chiefs, which shall excel in the number and valor of
      his companions. It is their dignity, their strength, to be always
      surrounded with a large body of select youth, an ornament in peace, a
      bulwark in war. And not in his own country alone, but among the
      neighboring states, the fame and glory of each chief consists in being
      distinguished for the number and bravery of his companions. Such chiefs
      are courted by embassies; distinguished by presents; and often by their
      reputation alone decide a war.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. In the field of battle, it is disgraceful for the chief to be
      surpassed in valor; it is disgraceful for the companions not to equal
      their chief; but it is reproach and infamy during a whole succeeding life
      to retreat from the field surviving him. <a href="#linknote-88"
      name="linknoteref-88" id="linknoteref-88"><small>88</small></a> To aid, to
      protect him; to place their own gallant actions to the account of his
      glory, is their first and most sacred engagement. The chiefs fight for
      victory; the companions for their chief. If their native country be long
      sunk in peace and inaction, many of the young nobles repair to some other
      state then engaged in war. For, besides that repose is unwelcome to their
      race, and toils and perils afford them a better opportunity of
      distinguishing themselves; they are unable, without war and violence, to
      maintain a large train of followers. The companion requires from the
      liberality of his chief, the warlike steed, the bloody and conquering
      spear: and in place of pay, he expects to be supplied with a table, homely
      indeed, but plentiful. <a href="#linknote-89" name="linknoteref-89"
      id="linknoteref-89"><small>89</small></a> The funds for this munificence
      must be found in war and rapine; nor are they so easily persuaded to
      cultivate the earth, and await the produce of the seasons, as to challenge
      the foe, and expose themselves to wounds; nay, they even think it base and
      spiritless to earn by sweat what they might purchase with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. During the intervals of war, they pass their time less in hunting than
      in a sluggish repose, <a href="#linknote-90" name="linknoteref-90"
      id="linknoteref-90"><small>90</small></a> divided between sleep and the
      table. All the bravest of the warriors, committing the care of the house,
      the family affairs, and the lands, to the women, old men, and weaker part
      of the domestics, stupefy themselves in inaction: so wonderful is the
      contrast presented by nature, that the same persons love indolence, and
      hate tranquillity! <a href="#linknote-91" name="linknoteref-91"
      id="linknoteref-91"><small>91</small></a> It is customary for the several
      states to present, by voluntary and individual contributions, <a
      href="#linknote-92" name="linknoteref-92" id="linknoteref-92"><small>92</small></a>
      cattle or grain <a href="#linknote-93" name="linknoteref-93"
      id="linknoteref-93"><small>93</small></a> to their chiefs; which are
      accepted as honorary gifts, while they serve as necessary supplies. <a
      href="#linknote-94" name="linknoteref-94" id="linknoteref-94"><small>94</small></a>
      They are peculiarly pleased with presents from neighboring nations,
      offered not only by individuals, but by the community at large; such as
      fine horses, heavy armor, rich housings, and gold chains. We have now
      taught them also to accept of money. <a href="#linknote-95"
      name="linknoteref-95" id="linknoteref-95"><small>95</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      16. It is well known that none of the German nations inhabit cities; <a
      href="#linknote-96" name="linknoteref-96" id="linknoteref-96"><small>96</small></a>
      or even admit of contiguous settlements. They dwell scattered and
      separate, as a spring, a meadow, or a grove may chance to invite them.
      Their villages are laid out, not like ours in rows of adjoining buildings;
      but every one surrounds his house with a vacant space, <a
      href="#linknote-97" name="linknoteref-97" id="linknoteref-97"><small>97</small></a>
      either by way of security against fire, <a href="#linknote-98"
      name="linknoteref-98" id="linknoteref-98"><small>98</small></a> or through
      ignorance of the art of building. For, indeed, they are unacquainted with
      the use of mortar and tiles; and for every purpose employ rude unshapen
      timber, fashioned with no regard to pleasing the eye. They bestow more
      than ordinary pains in coating certain parts of their buildings with a
      kind of earth, so pure and shining that it gives the appearance of
      painting. They also dig subterraneous caves, <a href="#linknote-99"
      name="linknoteref-99" id="linknoteref-99"><small>99</small></a> and cover
      them over with a great quantity of dung. These they use as
      winter-retreats, and granaries; for they preserve a moderate temperature;
      and upon an invasion, when the open country is plundered, these recesses
      remain unviolated, either because the enemy is ignorant of them, or
      because he will not trouble himself with the search. <a
      href="#linknote-100" name="linknoteref-100" id="linknoteref-100"><small>100</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      17. The clothing common to all is a sagum <a href="#linknote-101"
      name="linknoteref-101" id="linknoteref-101"><small>101</small></a>
      fastened by a clasp, or, in want of that, a thorn. With no other covering,
      they pass whole days on the hearth, before the fire. The more wealthy are
      distinguished by a vest, not flowing loose, like those of the Sarmatians
      and Parthians, but girt close, and exhibiting the shape of every limb.
      They also wear the skins of beasts, which the people near the borders are
      less curious in selecting or preparing than the more remote inhabitants,
      who cannot by commerce procure other clothing. These make choice of
      particular skins, which they variegate with spots, and strips of the furs
      of marine animals, <a href="#linknote-102" name="linknoteref-102"
      id="linknoteref-102"><small>102</small></a> the produce of the exterior
      ocean, and seas to us unknown. <a href="#linknote-103"
      name="linknoteref-103" id="linknoteref-103"><small>103</small></a> The
      dress of the women does not differ from that of the men; except that they
      more frequently wear linen, <a href="#linknote-104" name="linknoteref-104"
      id="linknoteref-104"><small>104</small></a> which they stain with purple;
      <a href="#linknote-105" name="linknoteref-105" id="linknoteref-105"><small>105</small></a>
      and do not lengthen their upper garment into sleeves, but leave exposed
      the whole arm, and part of the breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. The matrimonial bond is, nevertheless, strict and severe among them;
      nor is there anything in their manners more commendable than this. <a
      href="#linknote-106" name="linknoteref-106" id="linknoteref-106"><small>106</small></a>
      Almost singly among the barbarians, they content themselves with one wife;
      a very few of them excepted, who, not through incontinence, but because
      their alliance is solicited on account of their rank, <a
      href="#linknote-107" name="linknoteref-107" id="linknoteref-107"><small>107</small></a>
      practise polygamy. The wife does not bring a dowry to her husband, but
      receives one from him. <a href="#linknote-108" name="linknoteref-108"
      id="linknoteref-108"><small>108</small></a> The parents and relations
      assemble, and pass their approbation on the presents&mdash;presents not
      adapted to please a female taste, or decorate the bride; but oxen, a
      caparisoned steed, a shield, spear, and sword. By virtue of these, the
      wife is espoused; and she in her turn makes a present of some arms to her
      husband. This they consider as the firmest bond of union; these, the
      sacred mysteries, the conjugal deities. That the woman may not think
      herself excused from exertions of fortitude, or exempt from the casualties
      of war, she is admonished by the very ceremonial of her marriage, that she
      comes to her husband as a partner in toils and dangers; to suffer and to
      dare equally with him, in peace and in war: this is indicated by the yoked
      oxen, the harnessed steed, the offered arms. Thus she is to live; thus to
      die. She receives what she is to return inviolate <a href="#linknote-109"
      name="linknoteref-109" id="linknoteref-109"><small>109</small></a> and
      honored to her children; what her daughters-in-law are to receive, and
      again transmit to her grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. They live, therefore, fenced around with chastity; <a
      href="#linknote-110" name="linknoteref-110" id="linknoteref-110"><small>110</small></a>
      corrupted by no seductive spectacles, <a href="#linknote-111"
      name="linknoteref-111" id="linknoteref-111"><small>111</small></a> no
      convivial incitements. Men and women are alike unacquainted with
      clandestine correspondence. Adultery is extremely rare among so numerous a
      people. Its punishment is instant, and at the pleasure of the husband. He
      cuts off the hair <a href="#linknote-112" name="linknoteref-112"
      id="linknoteref-112"><small>112</small></a> of the offender, strips her,
      and in presence of her relations expels her from his house, and pursues
      her with stripes through the whole village. <a href="#linknote-113"
      name="linknoteref-113" id="linknoteref-113"><small>113</small></a> Nor is
      any indulgence shown to a prostitute. Neither beauty, youth, nor riches
      can procure her a husband: for none there looks on vice with a smile, or
      calls mutual seduction the way of the world. Still more exemplary is the
      practice of those states <a href="#linknote-114" name="linknoteref-114"
      id="linknoteref-114"><small>114</small></a> in which none but virgins
      marry, and the expectations and wishes of a wife are at once brought to a
      period. Thus, they take one husband as one body and one life; that no
      thought, no desire, may extend beyond him; and he may be loved not only as
      their husband, but as their marriage. <a href="#linknote-115"
      name="linknoteref-115" id="linknoteref-115"><small>115</small></a> To
      limit the increase of children, <a href="#linknote-116"
      name="linknoteref-116" id="linknoteref-116"><small>116</small></a> or put
      to death any of the later progeny <a href="#linknote-117"
      name="linknoteref-117" id="linknoteref-117"><small>117</small></a> is
      accounted infamous: and good habits have there more influence than good
      laws elsewhere. <a href="#linknote-118" name="linknoteref-118"
      id="linknoteref-118"><small>118</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      20. In every house the children grow up, thinly and meanly clad, <a
      href="#linknote-119" name="linknoteref-119" id="linknoteref-119"><small>119</small></a>
      to that bulk of body and limb which we behold with wonder. Every mother
      suckles her own children, and does not deliver them into the hands of
      servants and nurses. No indulgence distinguishes the young master from the
      slave. They lie together amidst the same cattle, upon the same ground,
      till age <a href="#linknote-120" name="linknoteref-120"
      id="linknoteref-120"><small>120</small></a> separates, and valor marks
      out, the free-born. The youths partake late of the pleasures of love, <a
      href="#linknote-121" name="linknoteref-121" id="linknoteref-121"><small>121</small></a>
      and hence pass the age of puberty unexhausted: nor are the virgins hurried
      into marriage; the same maturity, the same full growth is required: the
      sexes unite equally matched <a href="#linknote-122" name="linknoteref-122"
      id="linknoteref-122"><small>122</small></a> and robust; and the children
      inherit the vigor of their parents. Children are regarded with equal
      affection by their maternal uncles <a href="#linknote-123"
      name="linknoteref-123" id="linknoteref-123"><small>123</small></a> as by
      their fathers: some even consider this as the more sacred bond of
      consanguinity, and prefer it in the requisition of hostages, as if it held
      the mind by a firmer tie, and the family by a more extensive obligation. A
      person's own children, however, are his heirs and successors; and no wills
      are made. If there be no children, the next in order of inheritance are
      brothers, paternal and maternal uncles. The more numerous are a man's
      relations and kinsmen, the more comfortable is his old age; nor is it here
      any advantage to be childless. <a href="#linknote-124"
      name="linknoteref-124" id="linknoteref-124"><small>124</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      21. It is an indispensable duty to adopt the enmities <a
      href="#linknote-125" name="linknoteref-125" id="linknoteref-125"><small>125</small></a>
      of a father or relation, as well as their friendships: these, however, are
      not irreconcilable or perpetual. Even homicide is atoned <a
      href="#linknote-126" name="linknoteref-126" id="linknoteref-126"><small>126</small></a>
      by a certain fine in cattle and sheep; and the whole family accepts the
      satisfaction, to the advantage of the public weal, since quarrels are most
      dangerous in a free state. No people are more addicted to social
      entertainments, or more liberal in the exercise of hospitality. <a
      href="#linknote-127" name="linknoteref-127" id="linknoteref-127"><small>127</small></a>
      To refuse any person whatever admittance under their roof, is accounted
      flagitious. <a href="#linknote-128" name="linknoteref-128"
      id="linknoteref-128"><small>128</small></a> Every one according to his
      ability feasts his guest: when his provisions are exhausted, he who was
      late the host, is now the guide and companion to another hospitable board.
      They enter the next house uninvited, and are received with equal
      cordiality. No one makes a distinction with respect to the rights of
      hospitality, between a stranger and an acquaintance. The departing guest
      is presented with whatever he may ask for; and with the same freedom a
      boon is desired in return. They are pleased with presents; but think no
      obligation incurred either when they give or receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. <a href="#linknote-129" name="linknoteref-129" id="linknoteref-129"><small>129</small></a>
      [Their manner of living with their guest is easy and affable] As soon as
      they arise from sleep, which they generally protract till late in the day,
      they bathe, usually in warm water, <a href="#linknote-130"
      name="linknoteref-130" id="linknoteref-130"><small>130</small></a> as cold
      weather chiefly prevails there. After bathing they take their meal, each
      on a distinct seat, and a a separate table. <a href="#linknote-131"
      name="linknoteref-131" id="linknoteref-131"><small>131</small></a> Then
      they proceed, armed, to business, and not less frequently to convivial
      parties, in which it is no disgrace to pass days and nights, without
      intermission, in drinking. The frequent quarrels that arise amongst them,
      when intoxicated, seldom terminate in abusive language, but more
      frequently in blood. <a href="#linknote-132" name="linknoteref-132"
      id="linknoteref-132"><small>132</small></a> In their feasts, they
      generally deliberate on the reconcilement of enemies, on family alliances,
      on the appointment of chiefs, and finally on peace and war; conceiving
      that at no time the soul is more opened to sincerity, or warmed to
      heroism. These people, naturally void of artifice or disguise, disclose
      the most secret emotions of their hearts in the freedom of festivity. The
      minds of all being thus displayed without reserve, the subjects of their
      deliberation are again canvassed the next day; <a href="#linknote-133"
      name="linknoteref-133" id="linknoteref-133"><small>133</small></a> and
      each time has its advantages. They consult when unable to dissemble; they
      determine when not liable to mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. Their drink is a liquor prepared from barley or wheat <a
      href="#linknote-134" name="linknoteref-134" id="linknoteref-134"><small>134</small></a>
      brought by fermentation to a certain resemblance of wine. Those who border
      on the Rhine also purchase wine. Their food is simple; wild fruits, fresh
      venison, <a href="#linknote-135" name="linknoteref-135"
      id="linknoteref-135"><small>135</small></a> or coagulated milk. <a
      href="#linknote-136" name="linknoteref-136" id="linknoteref-136"><small>136</small></a>
      They satisfy hunger without seeking the elegances and delicacies of the
      table. Their thirst for liquor is not quenched with equal moderation. If
      their propensity to drunkenness be gratified to the extent of their
      wishes, intemperance proves as effectual in subduing them as the force of
      arms. <a href="#linknote-137" name="linknoteref-137" id="linknoteref-137"><small>137</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      24. They have only one kind of public spectacle, which is exhibited in
      every company. Young men, who make it their diversion, dance naked amidst
      drawn swords and presented spears. Practice has conferred skill at this
      exercise; and skill has given grace; but they do not exhibit for hire or
      gain: the only reward of this pastime, though a hazardous one, is the
      pleasure of the spectators. What is extraordinary, they play at dice, when
      sober, as a serious business: and that with such a desperate venture of
      gain or loss, that, when everything else is gone, they set their liberties
      and persons on the last throw. The loser goes into voluntary servitude;
      and, though the youngest and strongest, patiently suffers himself to be
      bound and sold. <a href="#linknote-138" name="linknoteref-138"
      id="linknoteref-138"><small>138</small></a> Such is their obstinacy in a
      bad practice&mdash;they themselves call it honor. The slaves thus acquired
      are exchanged away in commerce, that the winner may get rid of the scandal
      of his victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      25. The rest of their slaves have not, like ours, particular employments
      in the family allotted them. Each is the master of a habitation and
      household of his own. The lord requires from him a certain quantity of
      grain, cattle, or cloth, as from a tenant; and so far only the subjection
      of the slave extends. <a href="#linknote-139" name="linknoteref-139"
      id="linknoteref-139"><small>139</small></a> His domestic offices are
      performed by his own wife and children. It is usual to scourge a slave, or
      punish him with chains or hard labor. They are sometimes killed by their
      masters; not through severity of chastisement, but in the heat of passion,
      like an enemy; with this difference, that it is done with impunity. <a
      href="#linknote-140" name="linknoteref-140" id="linknoteref-140"><small>140</small></a>
      Freedmen are little superior to slaves; seldom filling any important
      office in the family; never in the state, except in those tribes which are
      under regal government. <a href="#linknote-141" name="linknoteref-141"
      id="linknoteref-141"><small>141</small></a> There, they rise above the
      free-born, and even the nobles: in the rest, the subordinate condition of
      the freedmen is a proof of freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      26. Lending money upon interest, and increasing it by usury, <a
      href="#linknote-142" name="linknoteref-142" id="linknoteref-142"><small>142</small></a>
      is unknown amongst them: and this ignorance more effectually prevents the
      practice than a prohibition would do. The lands are occupied by townships,
      <a href="#linknote-143" name="linknoteref-143" id="linknoteref-143"><small>143</small></a>
      in allotments proportional to the number of cultivators; and are
      afterwards parcelled out among the individuals of the district, in shares
      according to the rank and condition of each person. <a href="#linknote-144"
      name="linknoteref-144" id="linknoteref-144"><small>144</small></a> The
      wide extent of plain facilitates this partition. The arable lands are
      annually changed, and a part left fallow; nor do they attempt to make the
      most of the fertility and plenty of the soil, by their own industry in
      planting orchards, inclosing meadows, and watering gardens. Corn is the
      only product required from the earth: hence their year is not divided into
      so many seasons as ours; for, while they know and distinguish by name
      Winter, Spring, and Summer, they are unacquainted equally with the
      appellation and bounty of Autumn. <a href="#linknote-145"
      name="linknoteref-145" id="linknoteref-145"><small>145</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      27. Their funerals are without parade. <a href="#linknote-146"
      name="linknoteref-146" id="linknoteref-146"><small>146</small></a> The
      only circumstance to which they attend, is to burn the bodies of eminent
      persons with some particular kinds of wood. Neither vestments nor perfumes
      are heaped upon the pile: <a href="#linknote-147" name="linknoteref-147"
      id="linknoteref-147"><small>147</small></a> the arms of the deceased, and
      sometimes his horse, <a href="#linknote-148" name="linknoteref-148"
      id="linknoteref-148"><small>148</small></a> are given to the flames. The
      tomb is a mound of turf. They contemn the elaborate and costly honours of
      monumental structures, as mere burthens to the dead. They soon dismiss
      tears and lamentations; slowly, sorrow and regret. They think it the
      women's part to bewail their friends, the men's to remember them.
    </p>
    <p>
      28. This is the sum of what I have been able to learn concerning the
      origin and manners of the Germans in general. I now proceed to mention
      those particulars in which they differ from each other; and likewise to
      relate what nations have migrated from Germany into Gaul. That great
      writer, the deified Julius, asserts that the Gauls were formerly the
      superior people; <a href="#linknote-149" name="linknoteref-149"
      id="linknoteref-149"><small>149</small></a> whence it is probable that
      some Gallic colonies passed over into Germany: for how small an obstacle
      would a river be to prevent any nation, as it increased in strength, from
      occupying or changing settlements as yet lying in common, and
      unappropriated by the power of monarchies! Accordingly, the tract betwixt
      the Hercynian forest and the rivers Rhine and Mayne was possessed by the
      Helvetii: <a href="#linknote-150" name="linknoteref-150"
      id="linknoteref-150"><small>150</small></a> and that beyond, by the Boii;
      <a href="#linknote-151" name="linknoteref-151" id="linknoteref-151"><small>151</small></a>
      both Gallic tribes. The name of Boiemum still remains, a memorial of the
      ancient settlement, though its inhabitants are now changed. <a
      href="#linknote-152" name="linknoteref-152" id="linknoteref-152"><small>152</small></a>
      But whether the Aravisci <a href="#linknote-153" name="linknoteref-153"
      id="linknoteref-153"><small>153</small></a> migrated into Pannonia from
      the Osi, <a href="#linknote-154" name="linknoteref-154"
      id="linknoteref-154"><small>154</small></a> a German nation; or the Osi
      into Germany from the Aravisci; the language, institutions, and manners of
      both being still the same, is a matter of uncertainty; for, in their
      pristine state of equal indigence and equal liberty, the same advantages
      and disadvantages were common to both sides of the river. The Treveri <a
      href="#linknote-155" name="linknoteref-155" id="linknoteref-155"><small>155</small></a>
      and Nervii <a href="#linknote-156" name="linknoteref-156"
      id="linknoteref-156"><small>156</small></a> are ambitious of being thought
      of German origin; as if the reputation of this descent would distinguish
      them from the Gauls, whom they resemble in person and effeminacy. The
      Vangiones, Triboci, and Nemetes, <a href="#linknote-157"
      name="linknoteref-157" id="linknoteref-157"><small>157</small></a> who
      inhabit the bank of the Rhine, are without doubt German tribes. Nor do the
      Ubii, <a href="#linknote-158" name="linknoteref-158" id="linknoteref-158"><small>158</small></a>
      although they have been thought worthy of being made a Roman colony, and
      are pleased in bearing the name of Agrippinenses from their founder, blush
      to acknowledge their origin from Germany; from whence they formerly
      migrated, and for their approved fidelity were settled on the bank of the
      Rhine, not that they might be guarded themselves, but that they might
      serve as a guard against invaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      29. Of all these people, the most famed for valor are the Batavi; whose
      territories comprise but a small part of the banks of the Rhine, but
      consist chiefly of an island within it. <a href="#linknote-159"
      name="linknoteref-159" id="linknoteref-159"><small>159</small></a> These
      were formerly a tribe of the Catti, who, on account of an intestine
      division, removed to their present settlements, in order to become a part
      of the Roman empire. They still retain this honor, together with a
      memorial of their ancient alliance; <a href="#linknote-160"
      name="linknoteref-160" id="linknoteref-160"><small>160</small></a> for
      they are neither insulted by taxes, nor oppressed by farmers of the
      revenue. Exempt from fiscal burthens and extraordinary contributions, and
      kept apart for military use alone, they are reserved, like a magazine of
      arms, for the purposes of war. The nation of the Mattiaci <a
      href="#linknote-161" name="linknoteref-161" id="linknoteref-161"><small>161</small></a>
      is under a degree of subjection of the same kind: for the greatness of the
      Roman people has carried a reverence for the empire beyond the Rhine and
      the ancient limits. The Mattiaci, therefore, though occupying a settlement
      and borders <a href="#linknote-162" name="linknoteref-162"
      id="linknoteref-162"><small>162</small></a> on the opposite side of the
      river, from sentiment and attachment act with us; resembling the Batavi in
      every respect, except that they are animated with a more vigorous spirit
      by the soil and air of their own country. <a href="#linknote-163"
      name="linknoteref-163" id="linknoteref-163"><small>163</small></a> I do
      not reckon among the people of Germany those who occupy the Decumate
      lands, <a href="#linknote-164" name="linknoteref-164" id="linknoteref-164"><small>164</small></a>
      although inhabiting between the Rhine and Danube. Some of the most fickle
      of the Gauls, rendered daring through indigence, seized upon this district
      of uncertain property. Afterwards, our boundary line being advanced, and a
      chain of fortified posts established, it became a skirt of the empire, and
      part of the Roman province. <a href="#linknote-165" name="linknoteref-165"
      id="linknoteref-165"><small>165</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      30. Beyond these dwell the Catti, <a href="#linknote-166"
      name="linknoteref-166" id="linknoteref-166"><small>166</small></a> whose
      settlements, beginning from the Hercynian forest, are in a tract of
      country less open and marshy than those which overspread the other states
      of Germany; for it consists of a continued range of hills, which gradually
      become more scattered; and the Hercynian forest <a href="#linknote-167"
      name="linknoteref-167" id="linknoteref-167"><small>167</small></a> both
      accompanies and leaves behind, its Catti. This nation is distinguished by
      hardier frames, <a href="#linknote-168" name="linknoteref-168"
      id="linknoteref-168"><small>168</small></a> compactness of limb,
      fierceness of countenance, and superior vigor of mind. For Germans, they
      have a considerable share of understanding and sagacity; they choose able
      persons to command, and obey them when chosen; keep their ranks; seize
      opportunities; restrain impetuous motions; distribute properly the
      business of the day; intrench themselves against the night; account
      fortune dubious, and valor only certain; and, what is extremely rare, and
      only a consequence of discipline, depend more upon the general than the
      army. <a href="#linknote-169" name="linknoteref-169" id="linknoteref-169"><small>169</small></a>
      Their force consists entirely in infantry; who, besides their arms, are
      obliged to carry tools and provisions. Other nations appear to go to a
      battle; the Catti, to war. Excursions and casual encounters are rare
      amongst them. It is, indeed, peculiar to cavalry soon to obtain, and soon
      to yield, the victory. Speed borders upon timidity; slow movements are
      more akin to steady valor.
    </p>
    <p>
      31. A custom followed among the other German nations only by a few
      individuals, of more daring spirit than the rest, is adopted by general
      consent among the Catti. From the time they arrive at years of maturity
      they let their hair and beard grow; <a href="#linknote-170"
      name="linknoteref-170" id="linknoteref-170"><small>170</small></a> and do
      not divest themselves of this votive badge, the promise of valor, till
      they have slain an enemy. Over blood and spoils they unveil the
      countenance, and proclaim that they have at length paid the debt of
      existence, and have proved themselves worthy of their country and parents.
      The cowardly and effeminate continue in their squalid disguise. The
      bravest among them wear also an iron ring <a href="#linknote-171"
      name="linknoteref-171" id="linknoteref-171"><small>171</small></a> (a mark
      of ignominy in that nation) as a kind of chain, till they have released
      themselves by the slaughter of a foe. Many of the Catti assume this
      distinction, and grow hoary under the mark, conspicuous both to foes and
      friends. By these, in every engagement, the attack is begun: they compose
      the front line, presenting a new spectacle of terror. Even in peace they
      do not relax the sternness of their aspect. They have no house, land, or
      domestic cares: they are maintained by whomsoever they visit: lavish of
      another's property, regardless of their own; till the debility of age
      renders them unequal to such a rigid course of military virtue. <a
      href="#linknote-172" name="linknoteref-172" id="linknoteref-172"><small>172</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      32. Next to the Catti, on the banks of the Rhine, where, now settled in
      its channel, it is become a sufficient boundary, dwell the Usipii and
      Tencteri. <a href="#linknote-173" name="linknoteref-173"
      id="linknoteref-173"><small>173</small></a> The latter people, in addition
      to the usual military reputation, are famed for the discipline of their
      cavalry; nor is the infantry of the Catti in higher estimation than the
      horse of the Tencteri. Their ancestors established it, and are imitated by
      posterity. Horsemanship is the sport of their children, the point of
      emulation of their youth, and the exercise in which they persevere to old
      age. Horses are bequeathed along with the domestics, the household gods,
      and the rights of inheritance: they do not, however, like other things, go
      to the eldest son, but to the bravest and most warlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      33. Contiguous to the Tencteri were formerly the Bructeri; <a
      href="#linknote-174" name="linknoteref-174" id="linknoteref-174"><small>174</small></a>
      but report now says that the Chamavi and Angrivarii, <a
      href="#linknote-175" name="linknoteref-175" id="linknoteref-175"><small>175</small></a>
      migrating into their country, have expelled and entirely extirpated them,
      <a href="#linknote-176" name="linknoteref-176" id="linknoteref-176"><small>176</small></a>
      with the concurrence of the neighboring nations, induced either by hatred
      of their arrogance, <a href="#linknote-177" name="linknoteref-177"
      id="linknoteref-177"><small>177</small></a> love of plunder, or the favor
      of the gods towards the Romans. For they even gratified us with the
      spectacle of a battle, in which above sixty thousand Germans were slain,
      not by Roman arms, but, what was still grander, by mutual hostilities, as
      it were for our pleasure and entertainment. <a href="#linknote-178"
      name="linknoteref-178" id="linknoteref-178"><small>178</small></a> May the
      nations retain and perpetuate, if not an affection for us, at least an
      animosity against each other! since, while the fate of the empire is thus
      urgent, <a href="#linknote-179" name="linknoteref-179" id="linknoteref-179"><small>179</small></a>
      fortune can bestow no higher benefit upon us, than the discord of our
      enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      34. Contiguous to the Angrivarii and Chamavi backwards lie the Dulgibini,
      Chasauri, <a href="#linknote-180" name="linknoteref-180"
      id="linknoteref-180"><small>180</small></a> and other nations less known.
      <a href="#linknote-181" name="linknoteref-181" id="linknoteref-181"><small>181</small></a>
      In front, the Frisii <a href="#linknote-182" name="linknoteref-182"
      id="linknoteref-182"><small>182</small></a> succeed; who are distinguished
      by the appellations of Greater and Lesser, from their proportional power.
      The settlements of both stretch along the border of the Rhine to the
      ocean; and include, besides, vast lakes, <a href="#linknote-183"
      name="linknoteref-183" id="linknoteref-183"><small>183</small></a> which
      have been navigated by Roman fleets. We have even explored the ocean
      itself on that side; and fame reports that columns of Hercules <a
      href="#linknote-184" name="linknoteref-184" id="linknoteref-184"><small>184</small></a>
      are still remaining on that coast; whether it be that Hercules was ever
      there in reality, or that whatever great and magnificent is anywhere met
      with is, by common consent, ascribed to his renowned name. The attempt of
      Drusus Germanicus <a href="#linknote-185" name="linknoteref-185"
      id="linknoteref-185"><small>185</small></a> to make discoveries in these
      parts was sufficiently daring; but the ocean opposed any further inquiry
      into itself and Hercules. After a while no one renewed the attempt; and it
      was thought more pious and reverential to believe the actions of the gods,
      than to investigate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      35. Hitherto we have traced the western side of Germany. It turns from
      thence with a vast sweep to the north: and first occurs the country of the
      Chauci, <a href="#linknote-186" name="linknoteref-186" id="linknoteref-186"><small>186</small></a>
      which, though it begins immediately from Frisia, and occupies part of the
      seashore, yet stretches so far as to border on all the nations before
      mentioned, till it winds round so as to meet the territories of the Catti.
      This immense tract is not only possessed, but filled by the Chauci; a
      people the noblest of the Germans, who choose to maintain their greatness
      by justice rather than violence. Without ambition, without ungoverned
      desires, quiet and retired, they provoke no wars, they are guilty of no
      rapine or plunder; and it is a principal proof of their power and bravery,
      that the superiority they possess has not been acquired by unjust means.
      Yet all have arms in readiness; <a href="#linknote-187"
      name="linknoteref-187" id="linknoteref-187"><small>187</small></a> and, if
      necessary, an army is soon raised: for they abound in men and horses, and
      maintain their military reputation even in inaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      36. Bordering on the Chauci and Catti are the Cherusci; <a
      href="#linknote-188" name="linknoteref-188" id="linknoteref-188"><small>188</small></a>
      who, for want of an enemy, long cherished a too lasting and enfeebling
      peace: a state more flattering than secure; since the repose enjoyed
      amidst ambitious and powerful neighbors is treacherous; and when an appeal
      is made to the sword, moderation and probity are names appropriated by the
      victors. Thus, the Cherusci, who formerly bore the titles of just and
      upright, are now charged with cowardice and folly; and the good fortune of
      the Catti, who subdued them, has grown into wisdom. The ruin of the
      Cherusci involved that of the Fosi, <a href="#linknote-189"
      name="linknoteref-189" id="linknoteref-189"><small>189</small></a> a
      neighboring tribe, equal partakers of their adversity, although they had
      enjoyed an inferior share of their prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      37. In the same quarter of Germany, adjacent to the ocean, dwell the
      Cimbri; <a href="#linknote-191" name="linknoteref-191" id="linknoteref-191"><small>191</small></a>
      a small <a href="#linknote-192" name="linknoteref-192" id="linknoteref-192"><small>192</small></a>
      state at present, but great in renown. <a href="#linknote-193"
      name="linknoteref-193" id="linknoteref-193"><small>193</small></a> Of
      their past grandeur extensive vestiges still remain, in encampments and
      lines on either shore, <a href="#linknote-194" name="linknoteref-194"
      id="linknoteref-194"><small>194</small></a> from the compass of which the
      strength and numbers of the nation may still be computed, and credit
      derived to the account of so prodigious an army. It was in the 640th year
      of Rome that the arms of the Cimbri were first heard of, under the
      consulate of Caecilius Metellus and Papirius Carbo; from which era to the
      second consulate of the emperor Trajan <a href="#linknote-195"
      name="linknoteref-195" id="linknoteref-195"><small>195</small></a> is a
      period of nearly 210 years. So long has Germany withstood the arms of
      Rome. During this long interval many mutual wounds have been inflicted.
      Not the Samnite, the Carthaginian, Spain, Gaul, or Parthia, have given
      more frequent alarms; for the liberty of the Germans is more vigorous than
      the monarchy of the Arsacidae. What has the East, which has itself lost
      Pacorus, and suffered an overthrow from Ventidius, <a href="#linknote-196"
      name="linknoteref-196" id="linknoteref-196"><small>196</small></a> to
      boast against us, but the slaughter of Crassus? But the Germans, by the
      defeat or capture of Carbo, <a href="#linknote-197" name="linknoteref-197"
      id="linknoteref-197"><small>197</small></a> Cassius, <a
      href="#linknote-198" name="linknoteref-198" id="linknoteref-198"><small>198</small></a>
      Scaurus Aurelius, <a href="#linknote-199" name="linknoteref-199"
      id="linknoteref-199"><small>199</small></a> Servilius Caepio, and Cneius
      Manlius, <a href="#linknote-200" name="linknoteref-200"
      id="linknoteref-200"><small>200</small></a> deprived the Roman people of
      five consular armies; <a href="#linknote-201" name="linknoteref-201"
      id="linknoteref-201"><small>201</small></a> and afterwards took from
      Augustus himself Varus with three legions. <a href="#linknote-202"
      name="linknoteref-202" id="linknoteref-202"><small>202</small></a> Nor did
      Caius Marius <a href="#linknote-203" name="linknoteref-203"
      id="linknoteref-203"><small>203</small></a> in Italy, the deified Julius
      in Gaul, or Drusus,  Nero,  or Germanicus <a href="#linknote-204" name="linknoteref-204"
      id="linknoteref-204___"><small>204</small></a> in their own country,
      defeat then without loss. The subsequent mighty threats of Caligula
      terminated in ridicule. Then succeeded tranquillity; till, seizing the
      occasion of our discords and civil wars, they forced the winter-quarters
      of the legions, <a href="#linknote-205" name="linknoteref-205"
      id="linknoteref-205"><small>205</small></a> and even aimed at the
      possession of Gaul; and, again expelled thence, they have in latter times
      been rather triumphed over <a href="#linknote-206" name="linknoteref-206"
      id="linknoteref-206"><small>206</small></a> than vanquished.
    </p>
    <p>
      38. We have now to speak of the Suevi; <a href="#linknote-207"
      name="linknoteref-207" id="linknoteref-207"><small>207</small></a> who do
      not compose a single state, like the Catti or Tencteri, but occupy the
      greatest part of Germany, and are still distributed into different names
      and nations, although all hearing the common appellation of Suevi. It is a
      characteristic of this people to turn their hair sideways, and tie it
      beneath the poll in a knot. By this mark the Suevi are distinguished from
      the rest of the Germans; and the freemen of the Suevi from the slaves. <a
      href="#linknote-208" name="linknoteref-208" id="linknoteref-208"><small>208</small></a>
      Among other nations, this mode, either on account of some relationship
      with the Suevi, or from the usual propensity to imitation, is sometimes
      adopted; but rarely, and only during the period of youth. The Suevi, even
      till they are hoary, continue to have their hair growing stiffly
      backwards, and often it is fastened on the very crown of the head. The
      chiefs dress it with still greater care: and in this respect they study
      ornament, though of an undebasing kind. For their design is not to make
      love, or inspire it; they decorate themselves in this manner as they
      proceed to war, in order to seem taller and more terrible; and dress for
      the eyes of their enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      39. The Semnones <a href="#linknote-209" name="linknoteref-209"
      id="linknoteref-209"><small>209</small></a> assert themselves to be the
      most ancient and noble of the Suevi; and their pretensions are confirmed
      by religion. At a stated time, all the people of the same lineage assemble
      by their delegates in a wood, consecrated by the auguries of their
      forefathers and ancient terror, and there by the public slaughter of a
      human victim celebrate the horrid origin of their barbarous rites. Another
      kind of reverence is paid to the grove. No person enters it without being
      bound with a chain, as an acknowledgment of his inferior nature, and the
      power of the deity residing there. If he accidentally fall, it is not
      lawful for him to be lifted or to rise up; they roll themselves out along
      the ground. The whole of their superstition has this import: that from
      this spot the nation derives its origin; that here is the residence of the
      Deity, the Governor of all, and that everything else is subject and
      subordinate to him. These opinions receive additional authority from the
      power of the Semnones, who inhabit a hundred cantons, and, from the great
      body they compose, consider themselves as the head of the Suevi.
    </p>
    <p>
      40. The Langobardi, <a href="#linknote-210" name="linknoteref-210"
      id="linknoteref-210"><small>210</small></a> on the other hand, are
      ennobled by, the smallness of their numbers; since though surrounded by
      many powerful nations, they derive security, not from obsequiousness, but
      from their martial enterprise. The neighboring Reudigni, <a
      href="#linknote-211" name="linknoteref-211" id="linknoteref-211"><small>211</small></a>
      and the Avions, <a href="#linknote-212" name="linknoteref-212"
      id="linknoteref-212"><small>212</small></a> Angli, <a href="#linknote-213"
      name="linknoteref-213" id="linknoteref-213"><small>213</small></a> Varini,
      Eudoses, Suardones, and Nuithones, <a href="#linknote-214"
      name="linknoteref-214" id="linknoteref-214"><small>214</small></a> are
      defended by rivers or forests. Nothing remarkable occurs in any of these;
      except that they unite in the worship of Hertha, <a href="#linknote-215"
      name="linknoteref-215" id="linknoteref-215"><small>215</small></a> or
      Mother Earth; and suppose her to interfere in the affairs of men, and to
      visit the different nations. In an island <a href="#linknote-216"
      name="linknoteref-216" id="linknoteref-216"><small>216</small></a> of the
      ocean stands a sacred and unviolated grove, in which is a consecrated
      chariot, covered with a veil, which the priest alone is permitted to
      touch. He becomes conscious of the entrance of the goddess into this
      secret recess; and with profound veneration attends the vehicle, which is
      drawn by yoked cows. At this season, <a href="#linknote-217"
      name="linknoteref-217" id="linknoteref-217"><small>217</small></a> all is
      joy; and every place which the goddess deigns to visit is a scene of
      festivity. No wars are undertaken; arms are untouched; and every hostile
      weapon is shut up. Peace abroad and at home are then only known; then only
      loved; till at length the same priest reconducts the goddess, satiated
      with mortal intercourse, to her temple. <a href="#linknote-218"
      name="linknoteref-218" id="linknoteref-218"><small>218</small></a> The
      chariot, with its curtain, and, if we may believe it, the goddess herself,
      then undergo ablution in a secret lake. This office is performed by
      slaves, whom the same lake instantly swallows up. Hence proceeds a
      mysterious horror; and a holy ignorance of what that can be, which is
      beheld only by those who are about to perish. This part of the Suevian
      nation extends to the most remote recesses of Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      41. If we now follow the course of the Danube, as we before did that of
      the Rhine, we first meet with the Hermunduri; <a href="#linknote-219"
      name="linknoteref-219" id="linknoteref-219"><small>219</small></a> a
      people faithful to the Romans, <a href="#linknote-220"
      name="linknoteref-220" id="linknoteref-220"><small>220</small></a> and on
      that account the only Germans who are admitted to commerce, not on the
      bank alone, but within our territories, and in the flourishing colony <a
      href="#linknote-221" name="linknoteref-221" id="linknoteref-221"><small>221</small></a>
      established in the province of Rhaetia. They pass and repass at pleasure,
      without being attended by a guard; and while we exhibit to other nations
      our arms and camps alone, to these we lay open our houses and country
      seats, which they behold without coveting. In the country of the
      Hermunduri rises the Elbe; <a href="#linknote-222" name="linknoteref-222"
      id="linknoteref-222"><small>222</small></a> a river formerly celebrated
      and known among us, now only heard of by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      42. Contiguous to the Hermunduri are the Narisci; <a href="#linknote-223"
      name="linknoteref-223" id="linknoteref-223"><small>223</small></a> and
      next to them, the Marcomanni <a href="#linknote-224" name="linknoteref-224"
      id="linknoteref-224"><small>224</small></a> and Quadi. <a
      href="#linknote-225" name="linknoteref-225" id="linknoteref-225"><small>225</small></a>
      Of these, the Marcomanni are the most powerful and renowned; and have even
      acquired the country which they inhabit, by their valor in expelling the
      Boii. <a href="#linknote-226" name="linknoteref-226" id="linknoteref-226"><small>226</small></a>
      Nor are the Narisci and Quadi inferior in bravery; <a href="#linknote-227"
      name="linknoteref-227" id="linknoteref-227"><small>227</small></a> and
      this is, as it were, the van of Germany as far as it is bordered by the
      Danube. Within our memory the Marcomanni and Quadi were governed by kings
      of their own nation, of the noble line of Maroboduus <a
      href="#linknote-228" name="linknoteref-228" id="linknoteref-228"><small>228</small></a>
      and Tudrus. They now submit even to foreigners; but all the power of their
      kings depends upon the authority of the Romans. <a href="#linknote-229"
      name="linknoteref-229" id="linknoteref-229"><small>229</small></a> We
      seldom assist them with our arms, but frequently with our money; nor are
      they the less potent on that account.
    </p>
    <p>
      43. Behind these are the Marsigni, <a href="#linknote-230"
      name="linknoteref-230" id="linknoteref-230"><small>230</small></a>
      Gothini, <a href="#linknote-231" name="linknoteref-231"
      id="linknoteref-231"><small>231</small></a> Osi, <a href="#linknote-232"
      name="linknoteref-232" id="linknoteref-232"><small>232</small></a> and
      Burrii, <a href="#linknote-233" name="linknoteref-233" id="linknoteref-233"><small>233</small></a>
      who close the rear of the Marcomanni and Quadi. Of these, the Marsigni and
      Burrii in language <a href="#linknote-234" name="linknoteref-234"
      id="linknoteref-234"><small>234</small></a> and dress resemble the Suevi.
      The Gothini and Osi prove themselves not to be Germans; the first, by
      their use of the Gallic, the second, of the Pannonian tongue; and both, by
      their submitting to pay tribute: which is levied on them, as aliens,
      partly by the Sarmatians, partly by the Quadi. The Gothini, to their
      additional disgrace, work iron mines. <a href="#linknote-235"
      name="linknoteref-235" id="linknoteref-235"><small>235</small></a> All
      these people inhabit but a small proportion of champaign country; their
      settlements are chiefly amongst forests, and on the sides and summits of
      mountains; for a continued ridge of mountains <a href="#linknote-236"
      name="linknoteref-236" id="linknoteref-236"><small>236</small></a>
      separates Suevia from various remoter tribes. Of these, the Lygian <a
      href="#linknote-237" name="linknoteref-237" id="linknoteref-237"><small>237</small></a>
      is the most extensive, and diffuses its name through several communities.
      It will be sufficient to name the most powerful of them&mdash;the Arii,
      Helvecones, Manimi, Elysii, and Naharvali. <a href="#linknote-238"
      name="linknoteref-238" id="linknoteref-238"><small>238</small></a> In the
      country of the latter is a grove, consecrated to religious rites of great
      antiquity. A priest presides over them, dressed in woman's apparel; but
      the gods worshipped there are said, according to the Roman interpretation,
      to be Castor and Pollux. Their attributes are the same; their name, Alcis.
      <a href="#linknote-239" name="linknoteref-239" id="linknoteref-239"><small>239</small></a>
      No images, indeed, or vestiges of foreign superstition, appear in their
      worship; but they are revered under the character of young men and
      brothers. The Arii, fierce beyond the superiority of strength they possess
      over the other just enumerated people, improve their natural ferocity of
      aspect by artificial helps. Their shields are black; their bodies painted:
      <a href="#linknote-240" name="linknoteref-240" id="linknoteref-240"><small>240</small></a>
      they choose the darkest nights for an attack; and strike terror by the
      funereal gloom of their sable bands&mdash;no enemy being able to sustain
      their singular, and, as it were, infernal appearance; since in every
      combat the eyes are the first part subdued. Beyond the Lygii are the
      Gothones, <a href="#linknote-241" name="linknoteref-241"
      id="linknoteref-241"><small>241</small></a> who live under a monarchy,
      somewhat more strict than that of the other German nations, yet not to a
      degree incompatible with liberty. Adjoining to these are the Rugii <a
      href="#linknote-242" name="linknoteref-242" id="linknoteref-242"><small>242</small></a>
      and Lemovii, <a href="#linknote-243" name="linknoteref-243"
      id="linknoteref-243"><small>243</small></a> situated on the sea-coast&mdash;all
      these tribes are distinguished by round shields, short swords, and
      submission to regal authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      44. Next occur the communities of the Suiones, <a href="#linknote-244"
      name="linknoteref-244" id="linknoteref-244"><small>244</small></a> seated
      in the very Ocean, <a href="#linknote-245" name="linknoteref-245"
      id="linknoteref-245"><small>245</small></a> who, besides their strength in
      men and arms, also possess a naval force. <a href="#linknote-246"
      name="linknoteref-246" id="linknoteref-246"><small>246</small></a> The
      form of their vessels differs from ours in having a prow at each end, <a
      href="#linknote-247" name="linknoteref-247" id="linknoteref-247"><small>247</small></a>
      so that they are always ready to advance. They make no use of sails, nor
      have regular benches of oars at the sides: they row, as is practised in
      some rivers, without order, sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other,
      as occasion requires. These people honor wealth; <a href="#linknote-248"
      name="linknoteref-248" id="linknoteref-248"><small>248</small></a> for
      which reason they are subject to monarchical government, without any
      limitations, <a href="#linknote-249" name="linknoteref-249"
      id="linknoteref-249"><small>249</small></a> or precarious conditions of
      allegiance. Nor are arms allowed to be kept promiscuously, as among the
      other German nations: but are committed to the charge of a keeper, and he,
      too, a slave. The pretext is, that the Ocean defends them from any sudden
      incursions; and men unemployed, with arms in their hands, readily become
      licentious. In fact, it is for the king's interest not to entrust a noble,
      a freeman, or even an emancipated slave, with the custody of arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      45. Beyond the Suiones is another sea, sluggish and almost stagnant, <a
      href="#linknote-250" name="linknoteref-250" id="linknoteref-250"><small>250</small></a>
      by which the whole globe is imagined to be girt and enclosed, from this
      circumstance, that the last light of the setting sun continues so vivid
      till its rising, as to obscure the stars. <a href="#linknote-251"
      name="linknoteref-251" id="linknoteref-251"><small>251</small></a> Popular
      belief adds, that the sound of his emerging <a href="#linknote-252"
      name="linknoteref-252" id="linknoteref-252"><small>252</small></a> from
      the ocean is also heard; and the forms of deities, <a href="#linknote-253"
      name="linknoteref-253" id="linknoteref-253"><small>253</small></a> with
      the rays beaming from his head, are beheld. Only thus far, report says
      truly, does nature extend. <a href="#linknote-254" name="linknoteref-254"
      id="linknoteref-254"><small>254</small></a> On the right shore of the
      Suevic sea <a href="#linknote-255" name="linknoteref-255"
      id="linknoteref-255"><small>255</small></a> dwell the tribes of the
      Aestii, <a href="#linknote-256" name="linknoteref-256" id="linknoteref-256"><small>256</small></a>
      whose dress and customs are the same with those of the Suevi, but their
      language more resembles the British. <a href="#linknote-257"
      name="linknoteref-257" id="linknoteref-257"><small>257</small></a> They
      worship the mother of the gods; <a href="#linknote-258"
      name="linknoteref-258" id="linknoteref-258"><small>258</small></a> and as
      the symbol of their superstition, they carry about them the figures of
      wild boars. <a href="#linknote-259" name="linknoteref-259"
      id="linknoteref-259"><small>259</small></a> This serves them in place of
      armor and every other defence: it renders the votary of the goddess safe
      even in the midst of foes. Their weapons are chiefly clubs, iron being
      little used among them. They cultivate corn and other fruits of the earth
      with more industry than German indolence commonly exerts. <a
      href="#linknote-260" name="linknoteref-260" id="linknoteref-260"><small>260</small></a>
      They even explore the sea; and are the only people who gather amber, which
      by them is called <i>Glese</i>, <a href="#linknote-261"
      name="linknoteref-261" id="linknoteref-261"><small>261</small></a> and is
      collected among the shallows and upon the shore. <a href="#linknote-262"
      name="linknoteref-262" id="linknoteref-262"><small>262</small></a> With
      the usual indifference of barbarians, they have not inquired or
      ascertained from what natural object or by what means it is produced. It
      long lay disregarded <a href="#linknote-263" name="linknoteref-263"
      id="linknoteref-263"><small>263</small></a> amidst other things thrown up
      by the sea, till our luxury <a href="#linknote-264" name="linknoteref-264"
      id="linknoteref-264"><small>264</small></a> gave it a name. Useless to
      them, they gather it in the rough; bring it unwrought; and wonder at the
      price they receive. It would appear, however, to be an exudation from
      certain trees; since reptiles, and even winged animals, are often seen
      shining through it, which, entangled in it while in a liquid state, became
      enclosed as it hardened. <a href="#linknote-265" name="linknoteref-265"
      id="linknoteref-265"><small>265</small></a> I should therefore imagine
      that, as the luxuriant woods and groves in the secret recesses of the East
      exude frankincense and balsam, so there are the same in the islands and
      continents of the West; which, acted upon by the near rays of the sun,
      drop their liquid juices into the subjacent sea, whence, by the force of
      tempests, they are thrown out upon the opposite coasts. If the nature of
      amber be examined by the application of fire, it kindles like a torch,
      with a thick and odorous flame; and presently resolves into a glutinous
      matter resembling pitch or resin. The several communities of the Sitones
      <a href="#linknote-266" name="linknoteref-266" id="linknoteref-266"><small>266</small></a>
      succeed those of the Suiones; to whom they are similar in other respects,
      but differ in submitting to a female reign; so far have they degenerated,
      not only from liberty, but even from slavery. Here Suevia terminates.
    </p>
    <p>
      46. I am in doubt whether to reckon the Peucini, Venedi, and Fenni among
      the Germans or Sarmatians; <a href="#linknote-267" name="linknoteref-267"
      id="linknoteref-267"><small>267</small></a> although the Peucini, <a
      href="#linknote-268" name="linknoteref-268" id="linknoteref-268"><small>268</small></a>
      who are by some called Bastarnae, agree with the Germans in language,
      apparel, and habitations. <a href="#linknote-269" name="linknoteref-269"
      id="linknoteref-269"><small>269</small></a> All of them live in filth and
      laziness. The intermarriages of their chiefs with the Sarmatians have
      debased them by a mixture of the manners of that people. <a
      href="#linknote-270" name="linknoteref-270" id="linknoteref-270"><small>270</small></a>
      The Venedi have drawn much from this source; <a href="#linknote-271"
      name="linknoteref-271" id="linknoteref-271"><small>271</small></a> for
      they overrun in their predatory excursions all the woody and mountainous
      tracts between the Peucini and Fenni. Yet even these are rather to be
      referred to the Germans, since they build houses, carry shields, and
      travel with speed on foot; in all which particulars they totally differ
      from the Sarmatians, who pass their time in wagons and on horseback. <a
      href="#linknote-272" name="linknoteref-272" id="linknoteref-272"><small>272</small></a>
      The Fenni <a href="#linknote-273" name="linknoteref-273"
      id="linknoteref-273"><small>273</small></a> live in a state of amazing
      savageness and squalid poverty. They are destitute of arms, horses, and
      settled abodes: their food is herbs; <a href="#linknote-274"
      name="linknoteref-274" id="linknoteref-274"><small>274</small></a> their
      clothing, skins; their bed, the ground. Their only dependence is on their
      arrows, which, for want of iron, are headed with bone; <a
      href="#linknote-275" name="linknoteref-275" id="linknoteref-275"><small>275</small></a>
      and the chase is the support of the women as well as the men; the former
      accompany the latter in the pursuit, and claim a share of the prey. Nor do
      they provide any other shelter for their infants from wild beasts and
      storms, than a covering of branches twisted together. This is the resort
      of youth; this is the receptacle of old age. Yet even this way of life is
      in their estimation happier than groaning over the plough; toiling in the
      erection of houses; subjecting their own fortunes and those of others to
      the agitations of alternate hope and fear. Secure against men, secure
      against the gods, they have attained the most difficult point, not to need
      even a wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      All our further accounts are intermixed with fable; as, that the Hellusii
      and Oxionae <a href="#linknote-276" name="linknoteref-276"
      id="linknoteref-276"><small>276</small></a> have human faces, with the
      bodies and limbs of wild beasts. These unauthenticated reports I shall
      leave untouched. <a href="#linknote-277" name="linknoteref-277"

    <h2>
      THE LIFE OF CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      [This work is supposed by the commentators to have been written before the
      treatise on the manners of the Germans, in the third consulship of the
      emperor Nerva, and the second of Verginius Rufus, in the year of Rome 850,
      and of the Christian era 97. Brotier accedes to this opinion; but the
      reason which he assigns does not seem to be satisfactory. He observes that
      Tacitus, in the third section, mentions the emperor Nerva; but as he does
      not call him Divus Nerva, the deified Nerva, the learned commentator
      infers that Nerva was still living. This reasoning might have some weight,
      if we did not read, in section 44, that it was the ardent wish of Agricola
      that he might live to behold Trajan in the imperial seat. If Nerva was
      then alive, the wish to see another in his room would have been an awkward
      compliment to the reigning prince. It is, perhaps, for this reason that
      Lipsius thinks this very elegant tract was written at the same time with
      the Manners of the Germans, in the beginning of the emperor Trajan. The
      question is not very material, since conjecture alone must decide it. The
      piece itself is admitted to be a masterpiece in the kind. Tacitus was
      son-in-law to Agricola; and while filial piety breathes through his work,
      he never departs from the integrity of his own character. He has left an
      historical monument highly interesting to every Briton, who wishes to know
      the manners of his ancestors, and the spirit of liberty that from the
      earliest time distinguished the natives of Britain. "Agricola," as Hume
      observes, "was the general who finally established the dominion of the
      Romans in this island. He governed, it in the reigns of Vespasian, Titus,
      and Domitian. He carried his victorious arms northward: defeated the
      Britons in every encounter, pierced into the forests and the mountains of
      Caledonia, reduced every state to subjection in the southern parts of the
      island, and chased before him all the men of fiercer and more intractable
      spirits, who deemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude
      under the victors. He defeated them in a decisive action, which they
      fought under Galgacus; and having fixed a chain of garrisons between the
      friths of Clyde and Forth, he cut off the ruder and more barren parts of
      the island, and secured the Roman province from the incursions of the
      barbarous inhabitants. During these military enterprises he neglected not
      the arts of peace. He introduced laws and civility among the Britons;
      taught them to desire and raise all the conveniences of life; reconciled
      them to the Roman language and manners; instructed them in letters and
      science; and employed every expedient to render those chains, which he had
      forged, both easy and agreeable to them." (Hume's Hist. vol. i. p. 9.) In
      this passage Mr. Hume has given a summary of the Life of Agricola. It is
      extended by Tacitus in a style more open than the didactic form of the
      essay on the German Manners required, but still with the precision, both
      in sentiment and diction, peculiar to the author. In rich but subdued
      colors he gives a striking picture of Agricola, leaving to posterity a
      portion of history which it would be in vain to seek in the dry gazette
      style of Suetonius, or in the page of any writer of that period.]
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The ancient custom of transmitting to posterity the actions and manners
      of famous men, has not been neglected even by the present age, incurious
      though it be about those belonging to it, whenever any exalted and noble
      degree of virtue has triumphed over that false estimation of merit, and
      that ill-will to it, by which small and great states are equally infested.
      In former times, however, as there was a greater propensity and freer
      scope for the performance of actions worthy of remembrance, so every
      person of distinguished abilities was induced through conscious
      satisfaction in the task alone, without regard to private favor or
      interest, to record examples of virtue. And many considered it rather as
      the honest confidence of integrity, than a culpable arrogance, to become
      their own biographers. Of this, Rutilius and Scaurus <a
      href="#linknote-1001" name="linknoteref-1001" id="linknoteref-1001"><small>1</small></a>
      were instances; who were never yet censured on this account, nor was the
      fidelity of their narrative called in question; so much more candidly are
      virtues always estimated; in those periods which are the most favorable to
      their production. For myself, however, who have undertaken to be the
      historian of a person deceased, an apology seemed necessary; which I
      should not have made, had my course lain through times less cruel and
      hostile to virtue. <a href="#linknote-1002" name="linknoteref-1002"
      id="linknoteref-1002"><small>2</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. We read that when Arulenus Rusticus published the praises of Paetus
      Thrasea, and Herennius Senecio those of Priscus Helvidius, it was
      construed into a capital crime; <a href="#linknote-1003"
      name="linknoteref-1003" id="linknoteref-1003"><small>3</small></a> and
      the rage of tyranny was let loose not only against the authors, but
      against their writings; so that those monuments of exalted genius were
      burnt at the place of election in the forum by triumvirs appointed for the
      purpose. In that fire they thought to consume the voice of the Roman
      people, the freedom of the senate, and the conscious emotions of all
      mankind; crowning the deed by the expulsion of the professors of wisdom,
      <a href="#linknote-1004" name="linknoteref-1004" id="linknoteref-1004"><small>4</small></a>
      and the banishment of every liberal art, that nothing generous or
      honorable might remain. We gave, indeed, a consummate proof of our
      patience; and as remote ages saw the very utmost degree of liberty, so we,
      deprived by inquisitions of all the intercourse of conversation,
      experienced the utmost of slavery. With language we should have lost
      memory itself, had it been as much in our power to forget, as to be
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Now our spirits begin to revive. But although at the first dawning of
      this happy period, <a href="#linknote-1005" name="linknoteref-1005"
      id="linknoteref-1005"><small>5</small></a> the emperor Nerva united two
      things before incompatible, monarchy and liberty; and Trajan is now daily
      augmenting the felicity of the empire; and the public security <a
      href="#linknote-1006" name="linknoteref-1006" id="linknoteref-1006"><small>6</small></a>
      has not only assumed hopes and wishes, but has seen those wishes arise to
      confidence and stability; yet, from the nature of human infirmity,
      remedies are more tardy in their operation than diseases; and, as bodies
      slowly increase, but quickly perish, so it is more easy to suppress
      industry and genius, than to recall them. For indolence itself acquires a
      charm; and sloth, however odious at first, becomes at length engaging.
      During the space of fifteen years, <a href="#linknote-1007"
      name="linknoteref-1007" id="linknoteref-1007"><small>7</small></a> a
      large portion of human life, how great a number have fallen by casual
      events, and, as was the fate of all the most distinguished, by the cruelty
      of the prince; whilst we, the few survivors, not of others alone, but, if
      I may be allowed the expression, of ourselves, find a void of so many
      years in our lives, which has silently brought us from youth to maturity,
      from mature age to the very verge of life! Still, however, I shall not
      regret having composed, though in rude and artless language, a memorial of
      past servitude, and a testimony of present blessings. <a
      href="#linknote-1008" name="linknoteref-1008" id="linknoteref-1008"><small>8</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The present work, in the meantime, which is dedicated to the honor of my
      father-in-law, may be thought to merit approbation, or at least excuse,
      from the piety of the intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA was born at the ancient and illustrious colony
      of Forumjulii. <a href="#linknote-1009" name="linknoteref-1009"
      id="linknoteref-1009"><small>9</small></a> Both his grandfathers were
      imperial procurators, <a href="#linknote-10010" name="linknoteref-10010"
      id="linknoteref-10010"><small>10</small></a> an office which confers
      the rank of equestrian nobility. His father, Julius Graecinus, <a
      href="#linknote-10011" name="linknoteref-10011" id="linknoteref-10011"><small>11</small></a>
      of the senatorian order, was famous for the study of eloquence and
      philosophy; and by these accomplishments he drew on himself the
      displeasure of Caius Caesar; <a href="#linknote-10012"
      name="linknoteref-10012" id="linknoteref-10012"><small>12</small></a>
      for, being commanded to undertake the accusation of Marcus Silanus, <a
      href="#linknote-10013" name="linknoteref-10013" id="linknoteref-10013"><small>13</small></a>&mdash;on
      his refusal, he was put to death. His mother was Julia Procilla, a lady of
      exemplary chastity. Educated with tenderness in her bosom, <a
      href="#linknote-10014" name="linknoteref-10014" id="linknoteref-10014"><small>14</small></a>
      he passed his childhood and youth in the attainment of every liberal art.
      He was preserved from the allurements of vice, not only by a naturally
      good disposition, but by being sent very early to pursue his studies at
      Massilia; <a href="#linknote-10015" name="linknoteref-10015"
      id="linknoteref-10015"><small>15</small></a> a place where Grecian
      politeness and provincial frugality are happily united. I remember he was
      used to relate, that in his early youth he should have engaged with more
      ardor in philosophical speculation than was suitable to a Roman and a
      senator, had not the prudence of his mother restrained the warmth and
      vehemence of his disposition: for his lofty and upright spirit, inflamed
      by the charms of glory and exalted reputation, led him to the pursuit with
      more eagerness than discretion. Reason and riper years tempered his
      warmth; and from the study of wisdom, he retained what is most difficult
      to compass,&mdash;moderation.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. He learned the rudiments of war in Britain, under Suetonius Paullinus,
      an active and prudent commander, who chose him for his tent companion, in
      order to form an estimate of his merit. <a href="#linknote-10016"
      name="linknoteref-10016" id="linknoteref-10016"><small>16</small></a>
      Nor did Agricola, like many young men, who convert military service into
      wanton pastime, avail himself licentiously or slothfully of his
      tribunitial title, or his inexperience, to spend his time in pleasures and
      absences from duty; but he employed himself in gaining a knowledge of the
      country, making himself known to the army, learning from the experienced,
      and imitating the best; neither pressing to be employed through vainglory,
      nor declining it through timidity; and performing his duty with equal
      solicitude and spirit. At no other time in truth was Britain more agitated
      or in a state of greater uncertainty. Our veterans slaughtered, our
      colonies burnt, <a href="#linknote-10017" name="linknoteref-10017"
      id="linknoteref-10017"><small>17</small></a> our armies cut off, <a
      href="#linknote-10018" name="linknoteref-10018" id="linknoteref-10018"><small>18</small></a>&mdash;we
      were then contending for safety, afterwards for victory. During this
      period, although all things were transacted under the conduct and
      direction of another, and the stress of the whole, as well as the glory of
      recovering the province, fell to the general's share, yet they imparted to
      the young Agricola skill, experience, and incentives; and the passion for
      military glory entered his soul; a passion ungrateful to the times, <a
      href="#linknote-10019" name="linknoteref-10019" id="linknoteref-10019"><small>19</small></a>
      in which eminence was unfavorably construed, and a great reputation was no
      less dangerous than a bad one.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Departing thence to undertake the offices of magistracy in Rome, he
      married Domitia Decidiana, a lady of illustrious descent, from which
      connection he derived credit and support in his pursuit of greater things.
      They lived together in admirable harmony and mutual affection; each giving
      the preference to the other; a conduct equally laudable in both, except
      that a greater degree of praise is due to a good wife, in proportion as a
      bad one deserves the greater censure. The lot of quaestorship <a
      href="#linknote-10020" name="linknoteref-10020" id="linknoteref-10020"><small>20</small></a>
      gave him Asia for his province, and the proconsul Salvius Titianus <a
      href="#linknote-10021" name="linknoteref-10021" id="linknoteref-10021"><small>21</small></a>
      for his superior; by neither of which circumstances was he corrupted,
      although the province was wealthy and open to plunder, and the proconsul,
      from his rapacious disposition, would readily have agreed to a mutual
      concealment of guilt. His family was there increased by the birth of a
      daughter, who was both the support of his house, and his consolation; for
      he lost an elder-born son in infancy. The interval between his serving the
      offices of quaestor and tribune of the people, and even the year of the
      latter magistracy, he passed in repose and inactivity; well knowing the
      temper of the times under Nero, in which indolence was wisdom. He
      maintained the same tenor of conduct when praetor; for the judiciary part
      of the office did not fall to his share. <a href="#linknote-10022"
      name="linknoteref-10022" id="linknoteref-10022"><small>22</small></a>
      In the exhibition of public games, and the idle trappings of dignity, he
      consulted propriety and the measure of his fortune; by no means
      approaching to extravagance, yet inclining rather to a popular course.
      When he was afterwards appointed by Galba to manage an inquest concerning
      the offerings which had been presented to the temples, by his strict
      attention and diligence he preserved the state from any further sacrilege
      than what it had suffered from Nero. <a href="#linknote-10023"
      name="linknoteref-10023" id="linknoteref-10023"><small>23</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The following year <a href="#linknote-10024" name="linknoteref-10024"
      id="linknoteref-10024"><small>24</small></a> inflicted a severe wound
      on his peace of mind, and his domestic concerns. The fleet of Otho, roving
      in a disorderly manner on the coast, <a href="#linknote-10025"
      name="linknoteref-10025" id="linknoteref-10025"><small>25</small></a>
      made a hostile descent on Intemelii, <a href="#linknote-10026"
      name="linknoteref-10026" id="linknoteref-10026"><small>26</small></a> a
      part of Liguria, in which the mother of Agricola was murdered at her own
      estate, her lands were ravaged, and a great part of her effects, which had
      invited the assassins, was carried off. As Agricola upon this event was
      hastening to perform the duties of filial piety, he was overtaken by the
      news of Vespasian's aspiring to the empire, <a href="#linknote-10027"
      name="linknoteref-10027" id="linknoteref-10027"><small>27</small></a>
      and immediately went over to his party. The first acts of power, and the
      government of the city, were entrusted to Mucianus; Domitian being at that
      time very young, and taking no other privilege from his father's elevation
      than that of indulging his licentious tastes. Mucianus, having approved
      the vigor and fidelity of Agricola in the service of raising levies, gave
      him the command of the twentieth legion, <a href="#linknote-10028"
      name="linknoteref-10028" id="linknoteref-10028"><small>28</small></a>
      which had appeared backward in taking the oaths, as soon as he had heard
      the seditious practices of his commander. <a href="#linknote-10029"
      name="linknoteref-10029" id="linknoteref-10029"><small>29</small></a>
      This legion had been unmanageable and formidable even to the consular
      lieutenants; <a href="#linknote-10030" name="linknoteref-10030"
      id="linknoteref-10030"><small>30</small></a> and its late commander, of
      praetorian rank, had not sufficient authority to keep it in obedience;
      though it was uncertain whether from his own disposition, or that of his
      soldiers. Agricola was therefore appointed as his successor and avenger;
      but, with an uncommon degree of moderation, he chose rather to have it
      appear that he had found the legion obedient, than that he had made it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Vettius Bolanus was at that time governor of Britain, and ruled with a
      milder sway than was suitable to so turbulent a province. Under his
      administration, Agricola, accustomed to obey, and taught to consult
      utility as well as glory, tempered his ardor, and restrained his
      enterprising spirit. His virtues had soon a larger field for their
      display, from the appointment of Petilius Cerealis, <a
      href="#linknote-10031" name="linknoteref-10031" id="linknoteref-10031"><small>31</small></a>
      a man of consular dignity, to the government. At first he only shared the
      fatigues and dangers of his general; but was presently allowed to partake
      of his glory. Cerealis frequently entrusted him with part of his army as a
      trial of his abilities; and from the event sometimes enlarged his command.
      On these occasions, Agricola was never ostentatious in assuming to himself
      the merit of his exploits; but always, as a subordinate officer, gave the
      honor of his good fortune to his superior. Thus, by his spirit in
      executing orders, and his modesty in reporting his success, he avoided
      envy, yet did not fail of acquiring reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. On his return from commanding the legion he was raised by Vespasian to
      the patrician order, and then invested with the government of Aquitania,
      <a href="#linknote-10032" name="linknoteref-10032" id="linknoteref-10032"><small>32</small></a>
      a distinguished promotion, both in respect to the office itself, and the
      hopes of the consulate to which it destined him. It is a common
      supposition that military men, habituated to the unscrupulous and summary
      processes of camps, where things are carried with a strong hand, are
      deficient in the address and subtlety of genius requisite in civil
      jurisdiction. Agricola, however, by his natural prudence, was enabled to
      act with facility and precision even among civilians. He distinguished the
      hours of business from those of relaxation. When the court or tribunal
      demanded his presence, he was grave, intent, awful, yet generally inclined
      to lenity. When the duties of his office were over, the man of power was
      instantly laid aside. Nothing of sternness, arrogance, or rapaciousness
      appeared; and, what was a singular felicity, his affability did not impair
      his authority, nor his severity render him less beloved. To mention
      integrity and freedom from corruption in such a man, would be an affront
      to his virtues. He did not even court reputation, an object to which men
      of worth frequently sacrifice, by ostentation or artifice: equally
      avoiding competition with, his colleagues, <a href="#linknote-10033"
      name="linknoteref-10033" id="linknoteref-10033"><small>33</small></a>
      and contention with the procurators. To overcome in such a contest he
      thought inglorious; and to be put down, a disgrace. Somewhat less than
      three years were spent in this office, when he was recalled to the
      immediate prospect of the consulate; while at the same time a popular
      opinion prevailed that the government of Britain would be conferred upon
      him; an opinion not founded upon any suggestions of his own, but upon his
      being thought equal to the station. Common fame does not always err,
      sometimes it even directs a choice. When consul, <a href="#linknote-10034"
      name="linknoteref-10034" id="linknoteref-10034"><small>34</small></a>
      he contracted his daughter, a lady already of the happiest promise, to
      myself, then a very young man; and after his office was expired I received
      her in marriage. He was immediately appointed governor of Britain, and the
      pontificate <a href="#linknote-10035" name="linknoteref-10035"
      id="linknoteref-10035"><small>35</small></a> was added to his other
      dignities.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The situation and inhabitants of Britain have been described by many
      writers; <a href="#linknote-10036" name="linknoteref-10036"
      id="linknoteref-10036"><small>36</small></a> and I shall not add to the
      number with the view of vying with them in accuracy and ingenuity, but
      because it was first thoroughly subdued in the period of the present
      history. Those things which, while yet unascertained, they embellished
      with their eloquence, shall here be related with a faithful adherence to
      known facts. Britain, the largest of all the islands which have come
      within the knowledge of the Romans, stretches on the east towards Germany,
      on the west towards Spain, <a href="#linknote-10037"
      name="linknoteref-10037" id="linknoteref-10037"><small>37</small></a>
      and on the south it is even within sight of Gaul. Its northern extremity
      has no opposite land, but is washed by a wide and open sea. Livy, the most
      eloquent of ancient, and Fabius Rusticus, of modern writers, have likened
      the figure of Britain to an oblong target, or a two-edged axe. <a
      href="#linknote-10038" name="linknoteref-10038" id="linknoteref-10038"><small>38</small></a>
      And this is in reality its appearance, exclusive of Caledonia; whence it
      has been popularly attributed to the whole island. But that tract of
      country, irregularly stretching out to an immense length towards the
      furthest shore, is gradually contracted in form of a wedge. <a
      href="#linknote-10039" name="linknoteref-10039" id="linknoteref-10039"><small>39</small></a>
      The Roman fleet, at this period first sailing round this remotest coast,
      gave certain proof that Britain was an island; and at the same time
      discovered and subdued the Orcades, <a href="#linknote-10040"
      name="linknoteref-10040" id="linknoteref-10040"><small>40</small></a>
      islands till then unknown. Thule <a href="#linknote-10041"
      name="linknoteref-10041" id="linknoteref-10041"><small>41</small></a>
      was also distinctly seen, which winter and eternal snow had hitherto
      concealed. The sea is reported to be sluggish and laborious to the rower;
      and even to be scarcely agitated by winds. The cause of this stagnation I
      imagine to be the deficiency of land and mountains where tempests are
      generated; and the difficulty with which such a mighty mass of waters, in
      an uninterrupted main, is put in motion. <a href="#linknote-10042"
      name="linknoteref-10042" id="linknoteref-10042"><small>42</small></a>
      It is not the business of this work to investigate the nature of the ocean
      and the tides; a subject which many writers have already undertaken. I
      shall only add one circumstance: that the dominion of the sea is nowhere
      more extensive; that it carries many currents in this direction and in
      that; and its ebbings and flowings are not confined to the shore, but it
      penetrates into the heart of the country, and works its way among hills
      and mountains, as though it were in its own domain. <a
      href="#linknote-10043" name="linknoteref-10043" id="linknoteref-10043"><small>43</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Who were the first inhabitants of Britain, whether indigenous <a
      href="#linknote-10044" name="linknoteref-10044" id="linknoteref-10044"><small>44</small></a>
      or immigrants, is a question involved in the obscurity usual among
      barbarians. Their temperament of body is various, whence deductions are
      formed of their different origin. Thus, the ruddy hair and large limbs of
      the Caledonians <a href="#linknote-10045" name="linknoteref-10045"
      id="linknoteref-10045"><small>45</small></a> point out a German
      derivation. The swarthy complexion and curled hair of the Silures, <a
      href="#linknote-10046" name="linknoteref-10046" id="linknoteref-10046"><small>46</small></a>
      together with their situation opposite to Spain, render it probable that a
      colony of the ancient Iberi <a href="#linknote-10047"
      name="linknoteref-10047" id="linknoteref-10047"><small>47</small></a>
      possessed themselves of that territory. They who are nearest Gaul <a
      href="#linknote-10048" name="linknoteref-10048" id="linknoteref-10048"><small>48</small></a>
      resemble the inhabitants of that country; whether from the duration of
      hereditary influence, or whether it be that when lands jut forward in
      opposite directions, climate gives the same condition of body to the
      inhabitants of both. <a href="#linknote-10049" name="linknoteref-10049" id="linknoteref-10049"><small>49</small></a>
On a general survey, however, it appears probable
      that the Gauls originally took possession of the neighboring coast. The
      sacred rites and superstitions <a href="#linknote-10050"
      name="linknoteref-10050" id="linknoteref-10050"><small>50</small></a>
      of these people are discernible among the Britons. The languages of the
      two nations do not greatly differ. The same audacity in provoking danger,
      and irresolution in facing it when present, is observable in both. The
      Britons, however, display more ferocity, <a href="#linknote-10051"
      name="linknoteref-10051" id="linknoteref-10051"><small>51</small></a>
      not being yet softened by a long peace: for it appears from history that
      the Gauls were once renowned in war, till, losing their valor with their
      liberty, languor and indolence entered amongst them. The same change has
      also taken place among those of the Britons who have been long subdued; <a
      href="#linknote-10052" name="linknoteref-10052" id="linknoteref-10052"><small>52</small></a>
      but the rest continue such as the Gauls formerly were.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Their military strength consists in infantry; some nations also make
      use of chariots in war; in the management of which, the most honorable
      person guides the reins, while his dependents fight from the chariot. <a
      href="#linknote-10053" name="linknoteref-10053" id="linknoteref-10053"><small>53</small></a>
      The Britons were formerly governed by kings, <a href="#linknote-10054"
      name="linknoteref-10054" id="linknoteref-10054"><small>54</small></a>
      but at present they are divided in factions and parties among their
      chiefs; and this want of union for concerting some general plan is the
      most favorable circumstance to us, in our designs against so powerful a
      people. It is seldom that two or three communities concur in repelling the
      common danger; and thus, while they engage singly, they are all subdued.
      The sky in this country is deformed by clouds and frequent rains; but the
      cold is never extremely rigorous. <a href="#linknote-10055"
      name="linknoteref-10055" id="linknoteref-10055"><small>55</small></a>
      The length of the days greatly exceeds that in our part of the world. <a
      href="#linknote-10056" name="linknoteref-10056" id="linknoteref-10056"><small>56</small></a>
      The nights are bright, and, at the extremity of the island, so short, that
      the close and return of day is scarcely distinguished by a perceptible
      interval. It is even asserted that, when clouds do not intervene, the
      splendor of the sun is visible during the whole night, and that it does
      not appear to rise and set, but to move across. <a href="#linknote-10057"
      name="linknoteref-10057" id="linknoteref-10057"><small>57</small></a>
      The cause of this is, that the extreme and flat parts of the earth,
      casting a low shadow, do not throw up the darkness, and so night falls
      beneath the sky and the stars. <a href="#linknote-10058"
      name="linknoteref-10058" id="linknoteref-10058"><small>58</small></a>
      The soil, though improper for the olive, the vine, and other productions
      of warmer climates, is fertile, and suitable for corn. Growth is quick,
      but maturation slow; both from the same cause, the great humidity of the
      ground and the atmosphere. <a href="#linknote-10059"
      name="linknoteref-10059" id="linknoteref-10059"><small>59</small></a>
      The earth yields gold and silver <a href="#linknote-10060"
      name="linknoteref-10060" id="linknoteref-10060"><small>60</small></a>
      and other metals, the rewards of victory. The ocean produces pearls, <a
      href="#linknote-10061" name="linknoteref-10061" id="linknoteref-10061"><small>61</small></a>
      but of a cloudy and livid hue; which some impute to unskilfulness in the
      gatherers; for in the Red Sea the fish are plucked from the rocks alive
      and vigorous, but in Britain they are collected as the sea throws them up.
      For my own part, I can more readily conceive that the defect is in the
      nature of the pearls, than in our avarice.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The Britons cheerfully submit to levies, tributes, and the other
      services of government, if they are not treated injuriously; but such
      treatment they bear with impatience, their subjection only extending to
      obedience, not to servitude. Accordingly Julius Caesar, <a
      href="#linknote-10062" name="linknoteref-10062" id="linknoteref-10062"><small>62</small></a>
      the first Roman who entered Britain with an army, although he terrified
      the inhabitants by a successful engagement, and became master of the
      shore, may be considered rather to have transmitted the discovery than the
      possession of the country to posterity. The civil wars soon succeeded; the
      arms of the leaders were turned against their country; and a long neglect
      of Britain ensued, which continued even after the establishment of peace.
      This Augustus attributed to policy; and Tiberius to the injunctions of his
      predecessor. <a href="#linknote-10063" name="linknoteref-10063"
      id="linknoteref-10063"><small>63</small></a> It is certain that Caius
      Caesar <a href="#linknote-10064" name="linknoteref-10064"
      id="linknoteref-10064"><small>64</small></a> meditated an expedition
      into Britain; but his temper, precipitate in forming schemes, and unsteady
      in pursuing them, together with the ill success of his mighty attempts
      against Germany, rendered the design abortive. Claudius <a
      href="#linknote-10065" name="linknoteref-10065" id="linknoteref-10065"><small>65</small></a>
      accomplished the undertaking, transporting his legions and auxiliaries,
      and associating Vespasian in the direction of affairs, which laid the
      foundation of his future fortune. In this expedition, nations were
      subdued, kings made captive, and Vespasian was held forth to the fates.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Aulus Plautius, the first consular governor, and his successor,
      Ostorius Scapula, <a href="#linknote-10066" name="linknoteref-10066"
      id="linknoteref-10066"><small>66</small></a> were both eminent for
      military abilities. Under them, the nearest part of Britain was gradually
      reduced into the form of a province, and a colony of veterans <a
      href="#linknote-10067" name="linknoteref-10067" id="linknoteref-10067"><small>67</small></a>
      was settled. Certain districts were bestowed upon king Cogidunus, a prince
      who continued in perfect fidelity within our own memory. This was done
      agreeably to the ancient and long established practice of the Romans, to
      make even kings the instruments of servitude. Didius Gallus, the next
      governor, preserved the acquisitions of his predecessors, and added a very
      few fortified posts in the remoter parts, for the reputation of enlarging
      his province. Veranius succeeded, but died within the year. Suetonius
      Paullinus then commanded with success for two years, subduing various
      nations, and establishing garrisons. In the confidence with which this
      inspired him, he undertook an expedition against the island Mona, <a
      href="#linknote-10068" name="linknoteref-10068" id="linknoteref-10068"><small>68</small></a>
      which had furnished the revolters with supplies; and thereby exposed the
      settlements behind him to a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. For the Britons, relieved from present dread by the absence of the
      governor, began to hold conferences, in which they painted the miseries of
      servitude, compared their several injuries, and inflamed each other with
      such representations as these: "That the only effects of their patience
      were more grievous impositions upon a people who submitted with such
      facility. Formerly they had one king respectively; now two were set over
      them, the lieutenant and the procurator, the former of whom vented his
      rage upon their life's blood, the latter upon their properties; <a
      href="#linknote-10069" name="linknoteref-10069" id="linknoteref-10069"><small>69</small></a>
      the union or discord <a href="#linknote-10070" name="linknoteref-10070"
      id="linknoteref-10070"><small>70</small></a> of these governors was
      equally fatal to those whom they ruled, while the officers of the one, and
      the centurions of the other, joined in oppressing them by all kinds of
      violence and contumely; so that nothing was exempted from their avarice,
      nothing from their lust. In battle it was the bravest who took spoils; but
      those whom <i>they</i> suffered to seize their houses, force away their
      children, and exact levies, were, for the most part, the cowardly and
      effeminate; as if the only lesson of suffering of which they were ignorant
      was how to die for their country. Yet how inconsiderable would the number
      of invaders appear did the Britons but compute their own forces! From
      considerations like these, Germany had thrown off the yoke, <a
      href="#linknote-10071" name="linknoteref-10071" id="linknoteref-10071"><small>71</small></a>
      though a river <a href="#linknote-10072" name="linknoteref-10072"
      id="linknoteref-10072"><small>72</small></a> and not the ocean was its
      barrier. The welfare of their country, their wives, and their parents
      called them to arms, while avarice and luxury alone incited their enemies;
      who would withdraw as even the deified Julius had done, if the present
      race of Britons would emulate the valor of their ancestors, and not be
      dismayed at the event of the first or second engagement. Superior spirit
      and perseverence were always the share of the wretched; and the gods
      themselves now seemed to compassionate the Britons, by ordaining the
      absence of the general, and the detention of his army in another island.
      The most difficult point, assembling for the purpose of deliberation, was
      already accomplished; and there was always more danger from the discovery
      of designs like these, than from their execution."
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Instigated by such suggestions, they unanimously rose in arms, led by
      Boadicea, <a href="#linknote-10073" name="linknoteref-10073"
      id="linknoteref-10073"><small>73</small></a> a woman of royal descent
      (for they make no distinction between the sexes in succession to the
      throne), and attacking the soldiers dispersed through the garrisons,
      stormed the fortified posts, and invaded the colony <a
      href="#linknote-10074" name="linknoteref-10074" id="linknoteref-10074"><small>74</small></a>
      itself, as the seat of slavery. They omitted no species of cruelty with
      which rage and victory could inspire barbarians; and had not Paullinus, on
      being acquainted with the commotion of the province, marched speedily to
      its relief, Britain would have been lost. The fortune of a single battle,
      however, reduced it to its former subjection; though many still remained
      in arms, whom the consciousness of revolt, and particular dread of the
      governor, had driven to despair. Paullinus, although otherwise exemplary
      in his administration, having treated those who surrendered with severity,
      and having pursued too rigorous measures, as one who was revenging his own
      personal injury also, Petronius Turpilianus <a href="#linknote-10075"
      name="linknoteref-10075" id="linknoteref-10075"><small>75</small></a>
      was sent in his stead, as a person more inclined to lenity, and one who,
      being unacquainted with the enemy's delinquency, could more easily accept
      their penitence. After having restored things to their former quiet state,
      he delivered the command to Trebellius Maximus. <a href="#linknote-10076"
      name="linknoteref-10076" id="linknoteref-10076"><small>76</small></a>
      Trebellius, indolent, and inexperienced in military affairs, maintained
      the tranquillity of the province by popular manners; for even the
      barbarians had now learned to pardon under the seductive influence of
      vices; and the intervention of the civil wars afforded a legitimate excuse
      for his inactivity. Sedition however infected the soldiers, who, instead
      of their usual military services, were rioting in idleness. Trebellius,
      after escaping the fury of his army by flight and concealment, dishonored
      and abased, regained a precarious authority; and a kind of tacit compact
      took place, of safety to the general, and licentiousness to the army. This
      mutiny was not attended with bloodshed. Vettius Bolanus, <a
      href="#linknote-10077" name="linknoteref-10077" id="linknoteref-10077"><small>77</small></a>
      succeeding during the continuance of the civil wars, was unable to
      introduce discipline into Britain. The same inaction towards the enemy,
      and the same insolence in the camp, continued; except that Bolanus,
      unblemished in his character, and not obnoxious by any crime, in some
      measure substituted affection in the place of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. At length, when Vespasian received the possession of Britain together
      with the rest of the world, the great commanders and well-appointed armies
      which were sent over abated the confidence of the enemy; and Petilius
      Cerealis struck terror by an attack upon the Brigantes, <a
      href="#linknote-10078" name="linknoteref-10078" id="linknoteref-10078"><small>78</small></a>
      who are reputed to compose the most populous state in the whole province.
      Many battles were fought, some of them attended with much bloodshed; and
      the greater part of the Brigantes were either brought into subjection, or
      involved in the ravages of war. The conduct and reputation of Cerealis
      were so brilliant that they might have eclipsed the splendor of a
      successor; yet Julius Frontinus, <a href="#linknote-10079"
      name="linknoteref-10079" id="linknoteref-10079"><small>79</small></a> a
      truly great man, supported the arduous competition, as far as
      circumstances would permit. <a href="#linknote-10080"
      name="linknoteref-10080" id="linknoteref-10080"><small>80</small></a>
      He subdued the strong and warlike nation of the Silures, <a
      href="#linknote-10081" name="linknoteref-10081" id="linknoteref-10081"><small>81</small></a>
      in which expedition, besides the valor of the enemy, he had the
      difficulties of the country to struggle with.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. Such was the state of Britain, and such had been the vicissitudes of
      warfare, when Agricola arrived in the middle of summer; <a
      href="#linknote-10082" name="linknoteref-10082" id="linknoteref-10082"><small>82</small></a>
      at a time when the Roman soldiers, supposing the expeditions of the year
      were concluded, were thinking of enjoying themselves without care, and the
      natives, of seizing the opportunity thus afforded them. Not long before
      his arrival, the Ordovices <a href="#linknote-10083"
      name="linknoteref-10083" id="linknoteref-10083"><small>83</small></a>
      had cut off almost an entire corps of cavalry stationed on their
      frontiers; and the inhabitants of the province being thrown into a state
      of anxious suspense by this beginning, inasmuch as war was what they
      wished for, either approved of the example, or waited to discover the
      disposition of the new governor. <a href="#linknote-10084"
      name="linknoteref-10084" id="linknoteref-10084"><small>84</small></a>
      The season was now far advanced, the troops dispersed through the country,
      and possessed with the idea of being suffered to remain inactive during
      the rest of the year; circumstances which tended to retard and discourage
      any military enterprise; so that it was generally thought most advisable
      to be contented with defending the suspected posts: yet Agricola
      determined to march out and meet the approaching danger. For this purpose,
      he drew together the detachments from the legions, <a
      href="#linknote-10085" name="linknoteref-10085" id="linknoteref-10085"><small>85</small></a>
      and a small body of auxiliaries; and when he perceived that the Ordovices
      would not venture to descend into the plain, he led an advanced party in
      person to the attack, in order to inspire the rest of his troops with
      equal ardor. The result of the action was almost the total extirpation of
      the Ordovices; when Agricola, sensible that renown must be followed up,
      and that the future events of the war would be determined by the first
      success, resolved to make an attempt upon the island Mona, from the
      occupation of which Paullinus had been summoned by the general rebellion
      of Britain, as before related. <a href="#linknote-10086"
      name="linknoteref-10086" id="linknoteref-10086"><small>86</small></a>
      The usual deficiency of an unforeseen expedition appearing in the want of
      transport vessels, the ability and resolution of the general were exerted
      to supply this defect. A select body of auxiliaries, disencumbered of
      their baggage, who were well acquainted with the fords, and accustomed,
      after the manner of their country, to direct their horses and manage their
      arms while swimming, <a href="#linknote-10087" name="linknoteref-10087"
      id="linknoteref-10087"><small>87</small></a> were ordered suddenly to
      plunge into the channel; by which movement, the enemy, who expected the
      arrival of a fleet, and a formal invasion by sea, were struck with terror
      and astonishment, conceiving nothing arduous or insuperable to troops who
      thus advanced to the attack. They were therefore induced to sue for peace,
      and make a surrender of the island; an event which threw lustre on the
      name of Agricola, who, on the very entrance upon his province, had
      employed in toils and dangers that time which is usually devoted to
      ostentatious parade, and the compliments of office. Nor was he tempted, in
      the pride of success, to term that an expedition or a victory; which was
      only bridling the vanquished; nor even to announce his success in laureate
      despatches. <a href="#linknote-10088" name="linknoteref-10088"
      id="linknoteref-10088"><small>88</small></a> But this concealment of
      his glory served to augment it; since men were led to entertain a high
      idea of the grandeur of his future views, when such important services
      were passed over in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. Well acquainted with the temper of the province, and taught by the
      experience of former governors how little proficiency had been made by
      arms, when success was followed by injuries, he next undertook to
      eradicate the causes of war. And beginning with himself, and those next to
      him, he first laid restrictions upon his own household, a task no less
      arduous to most governors than the administration of the province. He
      suffered no public business to pass through the hands of his slaves or
      freedmen. In admitting soldiers into regular service, <a
      href="#linknote-10089" name="linknoteref-10089" id="linknoteref-10089"><small>89</small></a>
      to attendance about his person, he was not influenced by private favor, or
      the recommendation or solicitation of the centurions, but considered the
      best men as likely to prove the most faithful. He would know everything;
      but was content to let some things pass unnoticed. <a
      href="#linknote-10090" name="linknoteref-10090" id="linknoteref-10090"><small>90</small></a>
      He could pardon small faults, and use severity to great ones; yet did not
      always punish, but was frequently satisfied with penitence. He chose
      rather to confer offices and employments upon such as would not offend,
      than to condemn those who had offended. The augmentation <a
      href="#linknote-10091" name="linknoteref-10091" id="linknoteref-10091"><small>91</small></a>
      of tributes and contributions he mitigated by a just and equal assessment,
      abolishing those private exactions which were more grievous to be borne
      than the taxes themselves. For the inhabitants had been compelled in
      mockery to sit by their own locked-up granaries, to buy corn needlessly,
      and to sell it again at a stated price. Long and difficult journeys had
      also been imposed upon them; for the several districts, instead of being
      allowed to supply the nearest winter quarters, were forced to carry their
      corn to remote and devious places; by which means, what was easy to be
      procured by all, was converted into an article of gain to a few.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. By suppressing these abuses in the first year of his administration,
      he established a favorable idea of peace, which, through the negligence or
      oppression of his predecessors, had been no less dreaded than war. At the
      return of summer <a href="#linknote-10092" name="linknoteref-10092"
      id="linknoteref-10092"><small>92</small></a> he assembled his army. On
      their march, he commended the regular and orderly, and restrained the
      stragglers; he marked out the encampments, <a href="#linknote-10093"
      name="linknoteref-10093" id="linknoteref-10093"><small>93</small></a>
      and explored in person the estuaries and forests. At the same time he
      perpetually harassed the enemy by sudden incursions; and, after
      sufficiently alarming them, by an interval of forbearance, he held to
      their view the allurements of peace. By this management, many states,
      which till that time had asserted their independence, were now induced to
      lay aside their animosity, and to deliver hostages. These districts were
      surrounded with castles and forts, disposed with so much attention and
      judgment, that no part of Britain, hitherto new to the Roman arms, escaped
      unmolested.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. The succeeding winter was employed in the most salutary measures. In
      order, by a taste of pleasures, to reclaim the natives from that rude and
      unsettled state which prompted them to war, and reconcile them to quiet
      and tranquillity, he incited them, by private instigations and public
      encouragements, to erect temples, courts of justice, and dwelling-houses.
      He bestowed commendations upon those who were prompt in complying with his
      intentions, and reprimanded such as were dilatory; thus promoting a spirit
      of emulation which had all the force of necessity. He was also attentive
      to provide a liberal education for the sons of their chieftains,
      preferring the natural genius of the Britons to the attainments of the
      Gauls; and his attempts were attended with such success, that they who
      lately disdained to make use of the Roman language, were now ambitious of
      becoming eloquent. Hence the Roman habit began to be held in honor, and
      the toga was frequently worn. At length they gradually deviated into a
      taste for those luxuries which stimulate to vice; porticos, and baths, and
      the elegancies of the table; and this, from their inexperience, they
      termed politeness, whilst, in reality, it constituted a part of their
      slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. The military expeditions of the third year <a href="#linknote-10094"
      name="linknoteref-10094" id="linknoteref-10094"><small>94</small></a>
      discovered new nations to the Romans, and their ravages extended as far as
      the estuary of the Tay. <a href="#linknote-10095" name="linknoteref-10095"
      id="linknoteref-10095"><small>95</small></a> The enemies were thereby
      struck with such terror that they did not venture to molest the army
      though harassed by violent tempests; so that they had sufficient
      opportunity for the erection of fortresses. <a href="#linknote-10096"
      name="linknoteref-10096" id="linknoteref-10096"><small>96</small></a>
      Persons of experience remarked, that no general had ever shown greater
      skill in the choice of advantageous situations than Agricola; for not one
      of his fortified posts was either taken by storm, or surrendered by
      capitulation. The garrisons made frequent sallies; for they were secured
      against a blockade by a year's provision in their stores. Thus the winter
      passed without alarm, and each garrison proved sufficient for its own
      defence; while the enemy, who were generally accustomed to repair the
      losses of the summer by the successes of the winter, now equally
      unfortunate in both seasons, were baffled and driven to despair. In these
      transactions, Agricola never attempted to arrogate to himself the glory of
      others; but always bore an impartial testimony to the meritorious actions
      of his officers, from the centurion to the commander of a legion. He was
      represented by some as rather harsh in reproof; as if the same disposition
      which made him affable to the deserving, had inclined him to austerity
      towards the worthless. But his anger left no relics behind; his silence
      and reserve were not to be dreaded; and he esteemed it more honorable to
      show marks of open displeasure, than to entertain secret hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. The fourth summer <a href="#linknote-10097" name="linknoteref-10097"
      id="linknoteref-10097"><small>97</small></a> was spent in securing the
      country which had been overrun; and if the valor of the army and the glory
      of the Roman name had permitted it, our conquests would have found a limit
      within Britain itself. For the tides of the opposite seas, flowing very
      far up the estuaries of Clota and Bodotria, <a href="#linknote-10098"
      name="linknoteref-10098" id="linknoteref-10098"><small>98</small></a>
      almost intersect the country; leaving only a narrow neck of land, which
      was then defended by a chain of forts. <a href="#linknote-10099"
      name="linknoteref-10099" id="linknoteref-10099"><small>99</small></a>
      Thus all the territory on this side was held in subjection, and the
      remaining enemies were removed, as it were, into another island.
    </p>
    <p>
      24. In the fifth campaign, <a href="#linknote-100100"
      name="linknoteref-100100" id="linknoteref-100100"><small>100</small></a>
      Agricola, crossing over in the first ship, <a href="#linknote-100101"
      name="linknoteref-100101" id="linknoteref-100101"><small>101</small></a>
      subdued, by frequent and successful engagements, several nations till then
      unknown; and stationed troops in that part of Britain which is opposite to
      Ireland, rather with a view to future advantage, than from any
      apprehension of danger from that quarter. For the possession of Ireland,
      situated between Britain and Spain, and lying commodiously to the Gallic
      sea, <a href="#linknote-100102" name="linknoteref-100102"
      id="linknoteref-100102"><small>102</small></a> would have formed a very
      beneficial connection between the most powerful parts of the empire. This
      island is less than Britain, but larger than those of our sea. <a
      href="#linknote-100103" name="linknoteref-100103" id="linknoteref-100103"><small>103</small></a>
      Its soil, climate, and the manners and dispositions of its inhabitants,
      are little different from those of Britain. Its ports and harbors are
      better known, from the concourse of merchants for the purposes of
      commerce. Agricola had received into his protection one of its petty
      kings, who had been expelled by a domestic sedition; and detained him,
      under the semblance of friendship, till an occasion should offer of making
      use of him. I have frequently heard him assert, that a single legion and a
      few auxiliaries would be sufficient entirely to conquer Ireland and keep
      it in subjection; and that such an event would also have contributed to
      restrain the Britons, by awing them with the prospect of the Roman arms
      all around them, and, as it were, banishing liberty from their sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      25. In the summer which began the sixth year <a href="#linknote-100104"
      name="linknoteref-100104" id="linknoteref-100104"><small>104</small></a>
      of Agricola's administration, extending his views to the countries
      situated beyond Bodotria, <a href="#linknote-100105"
      name="linknoteref-100105" id="linknoteref-100105"><small>105</small></a>
      as a general insurrection of the remoter nations was apprehended, and the
      enemy's army rendered marching unsafe, he caused the harbors to be
      explored by his fleet, which, now first acting in aid of the land-forces
      gave the formidable spectacle of war at once pushed on by sea and land.
      The cavalry, infantry, and marines were frequently mingled in the same
      camp, and recounted with mutual pleasure their several exploits and
      adventures; comparing, in the boastful language of military men, the dark
      recesses of woods and mountains, with the horrors of waves and tempests;
      and the land and enemy subdued, with the conquered ocean. It was also
      discovered from the captives, that the Britons had been struck with
      consternation at the view of the fleet, conceiving the last refuge of the
      vanquished to be cut off, now the secret retreats of their seas were
      disclosed. The various inhabitants of Caledonia immediately took up arms,
      with great preparations, magnified, however, by report, as usual where the
      truth is unknown; and by beginning hostilities, and attacking our
      fortresses, they inspired terror as daring to act offensively; insomuch
      that some persons, disguising their timidity under the mask of prudence,
      were for instantly retreating on this side the firth, and relinquishing
      the country rather than waiting to be driven out. Agricola, in the
      meantime, being informed that the enemy intended to bear down in several
      bodies, distributed his army into three divisions, that his inferiority of
      numbers, and ignorance of the country, might not give them an opportunity
      of surrounding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      26. When this was known to the enemy, they suddenly changed their design;
      and making a general attack in the night upon the ninth legion, which was
      the weakest, <a href="#linknote-100106" name="linknoteref-100106"
      id="linknoteref-100106"><small>106</small></a> in the confusion of
      sleep and consternation they slaughtered the sentinels, and burst through
      the intrenchments. They were now fighting within the camp, when Agricola,
      who had received information of their march from his scouts, and followed
      close upon their track, gave orders for the swiftest of his horse and foot
      to charge the enemy's rear. Presently the whole army raised a general
      shout; and the standards now glittered at the approach of day. The Britons
      were distracted by opposite dangers; whilst the Romans in the camp resumed
      their courage, and secure of safety, began to contend for glory. They now
      in their turns rushed forwards to the attack, and a furious engagement
      ensued in the gates of the camp; till by the emulous efforts of both Roman
      armies, one to give assistance, the other to appear not to need it, the
      enemy was routed: and had not the woods and marshes sheltered the
      fugitives, that day would have terminated the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      27. The soldiers, inspirited by the steadfastness which characterized and
      the fame which attended this victory, cried out that "nothing could resist
      their valor; now was the time to penetrate into the heart of Caledonia,
      and in a continued series of engagements at length to discover the utmost
      limits of Britain." Those even who had before recommended caution and
      prudence, were now rendered rash and boastful by success. It is the hard
      condition of military command, that a share in prosperous events is
      claimed by all, but misfortunes are imputed to one alone. The Britons
      meantime, attributing their defeat not to the superior bravery of their
      adversaries, but to chance, and the skill of the general, remitted nothing
      of their confidence; but proceeded to arm their youth, to send their wives
      and children to places of safety, and to ratify the confederacy of their
      several states by solemn assemblies and sacrifices. Thus the parties
      separated with minds mutually irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      28. During the same summer, a cohort of Usipii, <a href="#linknote-100107"
      name="linknoteref-100107" id="linknoteref-100107"><small>107</small></a>
      which had been levied in Germany, and sent over into Britain, performed an
      extremely daring and memorable action. After murdering a centurion and
      some soldiers who had been incorporated with them for the purpose of
      instructing them in military discipline, they seized upon three light
      vessels, and compelled the masters to go on board with them. One of these,
      however, escaping to shore, they killed the other two upon suspicion; and
      before the affair was publicly known, they sailed away, as it were by
      miracle. They were presently driven at the mercy of the waves; and had
      frequent conflicts, with various success, with the Britons, defending
      their property from plunder. <a href="#linknote-100108"
      name="linknoteref-100108" id="linknoteref-100108"><small>108</small></a>
      At length they were reduced to such extremity of distress as to be obliged
      to feed upon each other; the weakest being first sacrificed, and then such
      as were taken by lot. In this manner having sailed round the island, they
      lost their ships through want of skill; and, being regarded as pirates,
      were intercepted, first by the Suevi, then by the Frisii. Some of them,
      after being sold for slaves, by the change of masters were brought to the
      Roman side of the river, <a href="#linknote-100109"
      name="linknoteref-100109" id="linknoteref-100109"><small>109</small></a>
      and became notorious from the relation of their extraordinary adventures.
      <a href="#linknote-100110" name="linknoteref-100110"
      id="linknoteref-100110"><small>110</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      29. In the beginning of the next summer, <a href="#linknote-100111"
      name="linknoteref-100111" id="linknoteref-100111"><small>111</small></a>
      Agricola received a severe domestic wound in the loss of a son, about a
      year old. He bore this calamity, not with the ostentatious firmness which
      many have affected, nor yet with the tears and lamentations of feminine
      sorrow; and war was one of the remedies of his grief. Having sent forwards
      his fleet to spread its ravages through various parts of the coast, in
      order to excite an extensive and dubious alarm, he marched with an army
      equipped for expedition, to which he had joined the bravest of the Britons
      whose fidelity had been approved by a long allegiance, and arrived at the
      Grampian hills, where the enemy was already encamped. <a
      href="#linknote-100112" name="linknoteref-100112" id="linknoteref-100112"><small>112</small></a>
      For the Britons, undismayed by the event of the former action, expecting
      revenge or slavery, and at length taught that the common danger was to be
      repelled by union alone, had assembled the strength of all their tribes by
      embassies and confederacies. Upwards of thirty thousand men in arms were
      now descried; and the youth, together with those of a hale and vigorous
      age, renowned in war, and bearing their several honorary decorations, were
      still flocking in; when Calgacus, <a href="#linknote-100113"
      name="linknoteref-100113" id="linknoteref-100113"><small>113</small></a>
      the most distinguished for birth and valor among the chieftans, is said to
      have harangued the multitude, gathering round, and eager for battle, after
      the following manner:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      30. "When I reflect on the causes of the war, and the circumstances of our
      situation, I feel a strong persuasion that our united efforts on the
      present day will prove the beginning of universal liberty to Britain. For
      we are all undebased by slavery; and there is no land behind us, nor does
      even the sea afford a refuge, whilst the Roman fleet hovers around. Thus
      the use of arms, which is at all times honorable to the brave, now offers
      the only safety even to cowards. In all the battles which have yet been
      fought, with various success, against the Romans, our countrymen may be
      deemed to have reposed their final hopes and resources in us: for we, the
      noblest sons of Britain, and therefore stationed in its last recesses, far
      from the view of servile shores, have preserved even our eyes unpolluted
      by the contact of subjection. We, at the furthest limits both of land and
      liberty, have been defended to this day by the remoteness of our situation
      and of our fame. The extremity of Britain is now disclosed; and whatever
      is unknown becomes an object of magnitude. But there is no nation beyond
      us; nothing but waves and rocks, and the still more hostile Romans, whose
      arrogance we cannot escape by obsequiousness and submission. These
      plunderers of the world, after exhausting the land by their devastations,
      are rifling the ocean: stimulated by avarice, if their enemy be rich; by
      ambition, if poor; unsatiated by the East and by the West: the only people
      who behold wealth and indigence with equal avidity. To ravage, to
      slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they
      make a desert, they call it peace. <a href="#linknote-100114"
      name="linknoteref-100114" id="linknoteref-100114"><small>114</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      31. "Our children and relations are by the appointment of nature the
      dearest of all things to us. These are torn away by levies to serve in
      foreign lands. <a href="#linknote-100115" name="linknoteref-100115"
      id="linknoteref-100115"><small>115</small></a> Our wives and sisters,
      though they should escape the violation of hostile force, are polluted
      under names of friendship and hospitality. Our estates and possessions are
      consumed in tributes; our grain in contributions. Even our bodies are worn
      down amidst stripes and insults in clearing woods and draining marshes.
      Wretches born to slavery are once bought, and afterwards maintained by
      their masters: Britain every day buys, every day feeds, her own servitude.
      <a href="#linknote-100116" name="linknoteref-100116"
      id="linknoteref-100116"><small>116</small></a> And as among domestic
      slaves every new comer serves for the scorn and derision of his fellows;
      so, in this ancient household of the world, we, as the newest and vilest,
      are sought out to destruction. For we have neither cultivated lands, nor
      mines, nor harbors, which can induce them to preserve us for our labors.
      The valor too and unsubmitting spirit of subjects only render them more
      obnoxious to their masters; while remoteness and secrecy of situation
      itself, in proportion as it conduces to security, tends to inspire
      suspicion. Since then all Lopes of mercy are vain, at length assume
      courage, both you to whom safety and you to whom glory is dear. The
      Trinobantes, even under a female leader, had force enough to burn a
      colony, to storm camps, and, if success had not damped their vigor, would
      have been able entirely to throw off the yoke; and shall not we,
      untouched, unsubdued, and struggling not for the acquisition but the
      security of liberty, show at the very first onset what men Caledonia has
      reserved for her defence?
    </p>
    <p>
      32. "Can you imagine that the Romans are as brave in war as they are
      licentious in peace? Acquiring renown from our discords and dissensions,
      they convert the faults of their enemies to the glory of their own army;
      an army compounded of the most different nations, which success alone has
      kept together, and which misfortune will as certainly dissipate. Unless,
      indeed, you can suppose that Gauls, and Germans, and (I blush to say it)
      even Britons, who, though they expend their blood to establish a foreign
      dominion, have been longer its foes than its subjects, will be retained by
      loyalty and affection! Terror and dread alone are the weak bonds of
      attachment; which once broken, they who cease to fear will begin to hate.
      Every incitement to victory is on our side. The Romans have no wives to
      animate them; no parents to upbraid their flight. Most of them have either
      no home, or a distant one. Few in number, ignorant of the country, looking
      around in silent horror at woods, seas, and a heaven itself unknown to
      them, they are delivered by the gods, as it were imprisoned and bound,
      into our hands. Be not terrified with an idle show, and the glitter of
      silver and gold, which can neither protect nor wound. In the very ranks of
      the enemy we shall find our own bands. The Britons will acknowledge their
      own cause. The Gauls will recollect their former liberty. The rest of the
      Germans will desert them, as the Usipii have lately done. Nor is there
      anything formidable behind them: ungarrisoned forts; colonies of old men;
      municipal towns distempered and distracted between unjust masters and
      ill-obeying subjects. Here is a general; here an army. There, tributes,
      mines, and all the train of punishments inflicted on slaves; which whether
      to bear eternally, or instantly to revenge, this field must determine.
      March then to battle, and think of your ancestors and your posterity."
    </p>
    <p>
      33. They received this harangue with alacrity, and testified their
      applause after the barbarian manner, with songs, and yells, and dissonant
      shouts. And now the several divisions were in motion, the glittering of
      arms was beheld, while the most daring and impetuous were hurrying to the
      front, and the line of battle was forming; when Agricola, although his
      soldiers were in high spirits, and scarcely to be kept within their
      intrenchments, kindled additional ardor by these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is now the eighth year, my fellow-soldiers, in which, under the high
      auspices of the Roman empire, by your valor and perseverance you have been
      conquering Britain. In so many expeditions, in so many battles, whether
      you have been required to exert your courage against the enemy, or your
      patient labors against the very nature of the country, neither have I ever
      been dissatisfied with my soldiers, nor you with your general. In this
      mutual confidence, we have proceeded beyond the limits of former
      commanders and former armies; and are now become acquainted with the
      extremity of the island, not by uncertain rumor, but by actual possession
      with our arms and encampments. Britain is discovered and subdued. How
      often on a march, when embarrassed with mountains, bogs and rivers, have I
      heard the bravest among you exclaim, 'When shall we descry the enemy? when
      shall we be led to the field of battle?' At length they are unharbored
      from their retreats; your wishes and your valor have now free scope; and
      every circumstance is equally propitious to the victor, and ruinous to the
      vanquished. For, the greater our glory in having marched over vast tracts
      of land, penetrated forests, and crossed arms of the sea, while advancing
      towards the foe, the greater will be our danger and difficulty if we
      should attempt a retreat. We are inferior to our enemies in knowledge of
      the country, and less able to command supplies of provision; but we have
      arms in our hands, and in these we have everything. For myself, it has
      long been my principle, that a retiring general or army is never safe. Hot
      only, then, are we to reflect that death with honor is preferable to life
      with ignominy, but to remember that security and glory are seated in the
      same place. Even to fall in this extremest verge of earth and of nature
      cannot be thought an inglorious fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      34. "If unknown nations or untried troops were drawn up against you, I
      would exhort you from the example of other armies. At present, recollect
      your own honors, question your own eyes. These are they, who, the last
      year, attacking by surprise a single legion in the obscurity of the night,
      were put to flight by a shout: the greatest fugitives of all the Britons,
      and therefore the longest survivors. As in penetrating woods and thickets
      the fiercest animals boldly rush on the hunters, while the weak and
      timorous fly at their very noise; so the bravest of the Britons have long
      since fallen: the remaining number consists solely of the cowardly and
      spiritless; whom you see at length within your reach, not because they
      have stood their ground, but because they are overtaken. Torpid with fear,
      their bodies are fixed and chained down in yonder field, which to you will
      speedily be the scene of a glorious and memorable victory. Here bring your
      toils and services to a conclusion; close a struggle of fifty years <a
      href="#linknote-100118" name="linknoteref-100118" id="linknoteref-100118"><small>118</small></a>
      with one great day; and convince your country-men, that to the army ought
      not to be imputed either the protraction of war, or the causes of
      rebellion."
    </p>
    <p>
      35. Whilst Agricola was yet speaking, the ardor of the soldiers declared
      itself; and as soon as he had finished, they burst forth into cheerful
      acclamations, and instantly flew to arms. Thus eager and impetuous, he
      formed them so that the centre was occupied by the auxiliary infantry, in
      number eight thousand, and three thousand horse were spread in the wings.
      The legions were stationed in the rear, before the intrenchments; a
      disposition which would render the victory signally glorious, if it were
      obtained without the expense of Roman blood; and would ensure support if
      the rest of the army were repulsed. The British troops, for the greater
      display of their numbers, and more formidable appearance, were ranged upon
      the rising grounds, so that the first line stood upon the plain, the rest,
      as if linked together, rose above one another upon the ascent. The
      charioteers <a href="#linknote-100119" name="linknoteref-100119"
      id="linknoteref-100119"><small>119</small></a> and horsemen filled the
      middle of the field with their tumult and careering. Then Agricola,
      fearing from the superior number of the enemy lest he should be obliged to
      fight as well on his flanks as in front, extended his ranks; and although
      this rendered his line of battle less firm, and several of his officers
      advised him to bring up the legions, yet, filled with hope, and resolute
      in danger, he dismissed his horse and took his station on foot before the
      colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      36. At first the action was carried on at a distance. The Britons, armed
      with long swords and short targets, <a href="#linknote-100120"
      name="linknoteref-100120" id="linknoteref-100120"><small>120</small></a>
      with steadiness and dexterity avoided or struck down our missile weapons,
      and at the same time poured in a torrent of their own. Agricola then
      encouraged three Batavian and two Tungrian <a href="#linknote-100121"
      name="linknoteref-100121" id="linknoteref-100121"><small>121</small></a>
      cohorts to fall in and come to close quarters; a method of fighting
      familiar to these veteran soldiers, but embarrassing to the enemy from the
      nature of their armor; for the enormous British swords, blunt at the
      point, are unfit for close grappling, and engaging in a confined space.
      When the Batavians; therefore, began to redouble their blows, to strike
      with the bosses of their shields, and mangle the faces of the enemy; and,
      bearing down all those who resisted them on the plain, were advancing
      their lines up the ascent; the other cohorts, fired with ardor and
      emulation, joined in the charge, and overthrew all who came in their way:
      and so great was their impetuosity in the pursuit of victory, that they
      left many of their foes half dead or unhurt behind them. In the meantime
      the troops of cavalry took to flight, and the armed chariots mingled in
      the engagement of the infantry; but although their first shock occasioned
      some consternation, they were soon entangled among the close ranks of the
      cohorts, and the inequalities of the ground. Not the least appearance was
      left of an engagement of cavalry; since the men, long keeping their ground
      with difficulty, were forced along with the bodies of the horses; and
      frequently, straggling chariots, and affrighted horses without their
      riders, flying variously as terror impelled them, rushed obliquely athwart
      or directly through the lines. <a href="#linknote-100122"
      name="linknoteref-100122" id="linknoteref-100122"><small>122</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      37. Those of the Britons who, yet disengaged from the fight, sat on the
      summits of the hills, and looked with careless contempt on the smallness
      of our numbers, now began gradually to descend; and would have fallen on
      the rear of the conquering troops, had not Agricola, apprehending this
      very event, opposed four reserved squadron of horse to their attack,
      which, the more furiously they had advanced, drove them back with the
      greater celerity. Their project was thus turned against themselves; and
      the squadrons were ordered to wheel from the front of the battle and fall
      upon the enemy's rear. A striking and hideous spectacle now appeared on
      the plain: some pursuing; some striking: some making prisoners, whom they
      slaughtered as others came in their way. Now, as their several
      dispositions prompted, crowds of armed Britons fled before inferior
      numbers, or a few, even unarmed, rushed upon their foes, and offered
      themselves to a voluntary death. Arms, and carcasses, and mangled limbs,
      were promiscuously strewed, and the field was dyed in blood. Even among
      the vanquished were seen instances of rage and valor. When the fugitives
      approached the woods, they collected, and surrounded the foremost of the
      pursuers, advancing incautiously, and unacquainted with the country; and
      had not Agricola, who was everywhere present, caused some strong and
      lightly-equipped cohorts to encompass the ground, while part of the
      cavalry dismounted made way through the thickets, and part on horseback
      scoured the open woods, some disaster would have proceeded from the excess
      of confidence. But when the enemy saw their pursuers again formed in
      compact order, they renewed their flight, not in bodies as before, or
      waiting for their companions, but scattered and mutually avoiding each
      other; and thus took their way to the most distant and devious retreats.
      Night and satiety of slaughter put an end to the pursuit. Of the enemy ten
      thousand were slain: on our part three hundred and sixty fell; among whom
      was Aulus Atticus, the praefect of a cohort, who, by his juvenile ardor,
      and the fire of his horse, was borne into the midst of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      38. Success and plunder contributed to render the night joyful to the
      victors; whilst the Britons, wandering and forlorn, amid the promiscuous
      lamentations of men and women, were dragging along the wounded; calling
      out to the unhurt; abandoning their habitations, and in the rage of
      despair setting them on fire; choosing places of concealment, and then
      deserting them; consulting together, and then separating. Sometimes, on
      beholding the dear pledges of kindred and affection, they were melted into
      tenderness, or more frequently roused into fury; insomuch that several,
      according to authentic information, instigated by a savage compassion,
      laid violent hands upon their own wives and children. On the succeeding
      day, a vast silence all around, desolate hills, the distant smoke of
      burning houses, and not a living soul descried by the scouts, displayed
      more amply the face of victory. After parties had been detached to all
      quarters without discovering any certain tracks of the enemy's flight, or
      any bodies of them still in arms, as the lateness of the season rendered
      it impracticable to spread the war through the country, Agricola led his
      army to the confines of the Horesti. <a href="#linknote-100123"
      name="linknoteref-100123" id="linknoteref-100123"><small>123</small></a>
      Having received hostages from this people, he ordered the commander of the
      fleet to sail round the island; for which expedition he was furnished with
      sufficient force, and preceded by the terror of the Roman name. Pie
      himself then led back the cavalry and infantry, marching slowly, that he
      might impress a deeper awe on the newly conquered nations; and at length
      distributed his troops into their winter-quarters. The fleet, about the
      same time, with prosperous gales and renown, entered the Trutulensian <a
      href="#linknote-100124" name="linknoteref-100124" id="linknoteref-100124"><small>124</small></a>
      harbor, whence, coasting all the hither shore of Britain, it returned
      entire to its former station. <a href="#linknote-100125"
      name="linknoteref-100125" id="linknoteref-100125"><small>125</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      39. The account of these transactions, although unadorned with the pomp of
      words in the letters of Agricola, was received by Domitian, as was
      customary with that prince, with outward expressions of joy, but inward
      anxiety. He was conscious that his late mock-triumph over Germany, <a
      href="#linknote-100126" name="linknoteref-100126" id="linknoteref-100126"><small>126</small></a>
      in which he had exhibited purchased slaves, whose habits and hair <a
      href="#linknote-100127" name="linknoteref-100127" id="linknoteref-100127"><small>127</small></a>
      were contrived to give them the resemblance of captives, was a subject of
      derision; whereas here, a real and important victory, in which so many
      thousands of the enemy were slain, was celebrated with universal applause.
      His greatest dread was that the name of a private man should be exalted
      above that of the prince. In vain had he silenced the eloquence of the
      forum, and cast a shade upon all civil honors, if military glory were
      still in possession of another. Other accomplishments might more easily be
      connived at, but the talents of a great general were truly imperial.
      Tortured with such anxious thoughts, and brooding over them in secret, <a
      href="#linknote-100128" name="linknoteref-100128" id="linknoteref-100128"><small>128</small></a>
      a certain indication of some malignant intention, he judged it most
      prudent for the present to suspend his rancor, tilt the first burst of
      glory and the affections of the army should remit: for Agricola still
      possessed the command in Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      40. He therefore caused the senate to decree him triumphal ornaments, <a
      href="#linknote-100129" name="linknoteref-100129" id="linknoteref-100129"><small>129</small></a>&mdash;a
      statue crowned with laurel, and all the other honors which are substituted
      for a real triumph, together with a profusion of complimentary
      expressions; and also directed an expectation to be raised that the
      province of Syria, vacant by the death of Atilius Rufus, a consular man,
      and usually reserved for persons of the greatest distinction, was designed
      for Agricola. It was commonly believed that one of the freedmen, who were
      employed in confidential services, was despatched with the instrument
      appointing Agricola to the government of Syria, with orders to deliver it
      if he should be still in Britain; but that this messenger, meeting
      Agricola in the straits, <a href="#linknote-100130"
      name="linknoteref-100130" id="linknoteref-100130"><small>130</small></a>
      returned directly to Domitian without so much as accosting him. <a
      href="#linknote-100131" name="linknoteref-100131" id="linknoteref-100131"><small>131</small></a>
      Whether this was really the fact, or only a fiction founded on the genius
      and character of the prince, is uncertain. Agricola, in the meantime, had
      delivered the province, in peace and security, to his successor; <a
      href="#linknote-100132" name="linknoteref-100132" id="linknoteref-100132"><small>132</small></a>
      and lest his entry into the city should be rendered too conspicuous by the
      concourse and acclamations of the people, he declined the salutation of
      his friends by arriving in the night; and went by night, as he was
      commanded, to the palace. There, after being received with a slight
      embrace, but not a word spoken, he was mingled with the servile throng. In
      this situation, he endeavored to soften the glare of military reputation,
      which is offensive to those who themselves live in indolence, by the
      practice of virtues of a different cast. He resigned himself to ease and
      tranquillity, was modest in his garb and equipage, affable in
      conversation, and in public was only accompanied by one or two of his
      friends; insomuch that the many, who are accustomed to form their ideas of
      great men from their retinue and figure, when they beheld Agricola, were
      apt to call in question his renown: few could interpret his conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      41. He was frequently, during that period, accused in his absence before
      Domitian, and in his absence also acquitted. The source of his danger was
      not any criminal action, nor the complaint of any injured person; but a
      prince hostile to virtue, and his own high reputation, and the worst kind
      of enemies, eulogists. <a href="#linknote-100133" name="linknoteref-100133"
      id="linknoteref-100133"><small>133</small></a> For the situation of
      public affairs which ensued was such as would not permit the name of
      Agricola to rest in silence: so many armies in Moesia, Dacia, Germany, and
      Pannonia lost through the temerity or cowardice of their generals; <a
      href="#linknote-100134" name="linknoteref-100134" id="linknoteref-100134"><small>134</small></a>
      so many men of military character, with numerous cohorts, defeated and
      taken prisoners; whilst a dubious contest was maintained, not for the
      boundaries, of the empire, and the banks of the bordering rivers, <a
      href="#linknote-100135" name="linknoteref-100135" id="linknoteref-100135"><small>135</small></a>
      but for the winter-quarters of the legions, and the possession of our
      territories. In this state of things, when loss succeeded loss, and every
      year was signalized by disasters and slaughters, the public voice loudly
      demanded Agricola for general: every one comparing his vigor, firmness,
      and experience in war, with the indolence and pusillanimity of the others.
      It is certain that the ears of Domitian himself were assailed by such
      discourses, while the best of his freedmen pressed him to the choice
      through motives of fidelity and affection, and the worst through envy and
      malignity, emotions to which he was of himself sufficiently prone. Thus
      Agricola, as well by his own virtues as the vices of others, was urged on
      precipitously to glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      42. The year now arrived in which the proconsulate of Asia or Africa must
      fall by lot upon Agricola; <a href="#linknote-100136"
      name="linknoteref-100136" id="linknoteref-100136"><small>136</small></a>
      and as Civica had lately been put to death, Agricola was not unprovided
      with a lesson, nor Domitian with an example. <a href="#linknote-100137"
      name="linknoteref-100137" id="linknoteref-100137"><small>137</small></a>
      Some persons, acquainted with the secret inclinations of the emperor, came
      to Agricola, and inquired whether he intended to go to his province; and
      first, somewhat distantly, began to commend a life of leisure and
      tranquillity; then offered their services in procuring him to be excused
      from the office; and at length, throwing off all disguise, after using
      arguments both to persuade and intimidate him, compelled him to accompany
      them to Domitian. The emperor, prepared to dissemble, and assuming an air
      of stateliness, received his petition for excuse, and suffered himself to
      be formally thanked <a href="#linknote-100138" name="linknoteref-100138"
      id="linknoteref-100138"><small>138</small></a> for granting it, without
      blushing at so invidious a favor. He did not, however, bestow on Agricola
      the salary <a href="#linknote-100139" name="linknoteref-100139"
      id="linknoteref-100139"><small>139</small></a> usually offered to a
      proconsul, and which he himself had granted to others; either taking
      offence that it was not requested, or feeling a consciousness that it
      would seem a bribe for what he had in reality extorted by his authority.
      It is a principle of human nature to hate those whom we have injured; <a
      href="#linknote-100140" name="linknoteref-100140" id="linknoteref-100140"><small>140</small></a>
      and Domitian was constitutionally inclined to anger, which was the more
      difficult to be averted, in proportion as it was the more disguised. Yet
      he was softened by the temper and prudence of Agricola; who did not think
      it necessary, by a contumacious spirit, or a vain ostentation of liberty,
      to challenge fame or urge his fate. <a href="#linknote-100141"
      name="linknoteref-100141" id="linknoteref-100141"><small>141</small></a>
      Let those be apprised, who are accustomed to admire every opposition to
      control, that even under a bad prince men may be truly great; that
      submission and modesty, if accompanied with vigor and industry, will
      elevate a character to a height of public esteem equal to that which many,
      through abrupt and dangerous paths, have attained, without benefit to
      their country, by an ambitious death.
    </p>
    <p>
      43. His decease was a severe affliction to his family, a grief to his
      friends, and a subject of regret even to foreigners, and those who had no
      personal knowledge of him. <a href="#linknote-100142"
      name="linknoteref-100142" id="linknoteref-100142"><small>142</small></a>
      The common people too, and the class who little interest themselves about
      public concerns, were frequent in their inquiries at his house during his
      sickness, and made him the subject of conversation at the forum and in
      private circles; nor did any person either rejoice at the news of his
      death, or speedily forget it. Their commiseration was aggravated by a
      prevailing report that he was taken off by poison. I cannot venture to
      affirm anything certain of this matter; <a href="#linknote-100143"
      name="linknoteref-100143" id="linknoteref-100143"><small>143</small></a>
      yet, during the whole course of his illness, the principal of the imperial
      freedmen and the most confidential of the physicians was sent much more
      frequently than was customary with a court whose visits were chiefly paid
      by messages; whether that was done out of real solicitude, or for the
      purposes of state inquisition. On the day of his decease, it is certain
      that accounts of his approaching dissolution were every instant
      transmitted to the emperor by couriers stationed for the purpose; and no
      one believed that the information, which so much pains was taken to
      accelerate, could be received with regret. He put on, however, in his
      countenance and demeanor, the semblance of grief: for he was now secured
      from an object of hatred, and could more easily conceal his joy than his
      fear. It was well known that on reading the will, in which he was
      nominated co-heir <a href="#linknote-100144" name="linknoteref-100144"
      id="linknoteref-100144"><small>144</small></a> with the excellent wife
      and most dutiful daughter of Agricola, he expressed great satisfaction, as
      if it had been a voluntary testimony of honor and esteem: so blind and
      corrupt had his mind been rendered by continual adulation, that he was
      ignorant none but a bad prince could be nominated heir to a good father.
    </p>
    <p>
      44. Agricola was born in the ides of June, during the third consulate of
      Caius Caesar; <a href="#linknote-100145" name="linknoteref-100145"
      id="linknoteref-100145"><small>145</small></a> he died in his
      fifty-sixth year, on the tenth of the calends of September, when Collega
      and Priscus were consuls. <a href="#linknote-100146"
      name="linknoteref-100146" id="linknoteref-100146"><small>146</small></a>
      Posterity may wish to form an idea of his person. His figure was comely
      rather than majestic. In his countenance there was nothing to inspire awe;
      its character was gracious and engaging. You would readily have believed
      him a good man, and willingly a great one. And indeed, although he was
      snatched away in the midst of a vigorous age, yet if his life be measured
      by his glory, it was a period of the greatest extent. For after the full
      enjoyment of all that is truly good, which is found in virtuous pursuits
      alone, decorated with consular and triumphal ornaments, what more could
      fortune contribute to his elevation? Immoderate wealth did not fall to his
      share, yet he possessed a decent affluence. <a href="#linknote-100147"
      name="linknoteref-100147" id="linknoteref-100147"><small>147</small></a>
      His wife and daughter surviving, his dignity unimpaired, his reputation
      flourishing, and his kindred and friends yet in safety, it may even be
      thought an additional felicity that he was thus withdrawn from impending
      evils. For, as we have heard him express his wishes of continuing to the
      dawn of the present auspicious day, and beholding Trajan in the imperial
      seat,&mdash;wishes in which he formed a certain presage of the event; so
      it is a great consolation, that by his untimely end he escaped that latter
      period, in which Domitian, not by intervals and remissions, but by a
      continued, and, as it were, a single act, aimed at the destruction of the
      commonwealth. <a href="#linknote-100148" name="linknoteref-100148"
      id="linknoteref-100148"><small>148</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      45. Agricola did not behold the senate-house besieged, and the senators
      enclosed by a circle of arms; <a href="#linknote-100149"
      name="linknoteref-100149" id="linknoteref-100149"><small>149</small></a>
      and in one havoc the massacre of so many consular men, the flight and
      banishment of so many honorable women. As yet Carus Metius <a
      href="#linknote-100150" name="linknoteref-100150" id="linknoteref-100150"><small>150</small></a>
      was distinguished only by a single victory; the counsels of Messalinus <a
      href="#linknote-100151" name="linknoteref-100151" id="linknoteref-100151"><small>151</small></a>
      resounded only through the Albanian citadel; <a href="#linknote-100152"
      name="linknoteref-100152" id="linknoteref-100152"><small>152</small></a>
      and Massa Baebius <a href="#linknote-100153" name="linknoteref-100153"
      id="linknoteref-100153"><small>153</small></a> was himself among the
      accused. Soon after, our own hands <a href="#linknote-100154"
      name="linknoteref-100154" id="linknoteref-100154"><small>154</small></a>
      dragged Helvidius <a href="#linknote-100155" name="linknoteref-100155"
      id="linknoteref-100155"><small>155</small></a> to prison; ourselves
      were tortured with the spectacle of Mauricus and Rusticus, <a
      href="#linknote-100156" name="linknoteref-100156" id="linknoteref-100156"><small>156</small></a>
      and sprinkled with the innocent blood of Senecio. <a
      href="#linknote-100157" name="linknoteref-100157" id="linknoteref-100157"><small>157</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Nero withdrew his eyes from the cruelties he commanded. Under
      Domitian, it was the principal part of our miseries to behold and to be
      beheld: when our sighs were registered; and that stern countenance, with
      its settled redness, <a href="#linknote-100158" name="linknoteref-100158"
      id="linknoteref-100158"><small>158</small></a> his defence against
      shame, was employed in noting the pallid horror of so many spectators.
      Happy, O Agricola! not only in the splendor of your life, but in the
      seasonableness of your death. With resignation and cheerfulness, from the
      testimony of those who were present in your last moments, did you meet
      your fate, as if striving to the utmost of your power to make the emperor
      appear guiltless. But to myself and your daughter, besides the anguish of
      losing a parent, the aggravating affliction remains, that it was not our
      lot to watch over your sick-bed, to support you when languishing, and to
      satiate ourselves with beholding and embracing you. With what attention
      should we have received your last instructions, and engraven them on our
      hearts! This is our sorrow; this is our wound: to us you were lost four
      years before by a tedious absence. Everything, doubtless, O best of
      parents! was administered for your comfort and honor, while a most
      affectionate wife sat beside you; yet fewer tears were shed upon your
      bier, and in the last light which your eyes beheld, something was still
      wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      46. If there be any habitation for the shades of the virtuous; if, as
      philosophers suppose, exalted souls do not perish with the body; may you
      repose in peace, and call us, your household, from vain regret and
      feminine lamentations, to the contemplation of your virtues, which allow
      no place for mourning or complaining! Let us rather adorn your memory by
      our admiration, by our short-lived praises, and, as far as our natures
      will permit, by an imitation of your example. This is truly to honor the
      dead; this is the piety of every near relation. I would also recommend it
      to the wife and daughter of this great man, to show their veneration of a
      husband's and a father's memory by revolving his actions and words in
      their breasts, and endeavoring to retain an idea of the form and features
      of his mind, rather than of his person. Not that I would reject those
      resemblances of the human figure which are engraven in brass or marbles
      but as their originals are frail and perishable, so likewise are they:
      while the form of the mind is eternal, and not to be retained or expressed
      by any foreign matter, or the artist's skill, but by the manners of the
      survivors. Whatever in Agricola was the object of our love, of our
      admiration, remains, and will remain in the minds of men, transmitted in
      the records of fame, through an eternity of years. For, while many great
      personages of antiquity will be involved in a common oblivion with the
      mean and inglorious, Agricola shall survive, represented and consigned to
      future ages.

      "bards;" it being a custom with the Gauls for bards to accompany the army,
      and celebrate the heroic deeds of their great warriors; so that <i>barditum</i>
      would thus signify "the fulfilment of the bard's office." Hence it is
      clear that <i>barditum</i> could not be used correctly here, inasmuch as
      amongst the Germans not any particular, appointed, body of men, but the
      whole army chanted forth the war-song. Some editions have <i>baritum</i>,
      which is said to be derived from the German word <i>beren</i>, or <i>baeren</i>,
      "to shout;" and hence it is translated in some dictionaries as, "the
      German war-song." From the following passage extracted from Facciolati, it
      would seem, however, that German critics repudiate this idea: "De <i>barito</i>

      reading worth nothing; and that <i>barritus</i> was not the name of the
      ancient German war-song, but of the shout raised by the Romans in later
      ages when on the point of engaging; and that it was derived "a clamore
      barrorem, <i>i.e.</i> elephantorum." The same learned editor considers
      that the words "quem barditum vocant" have been originally the marginal
      annotation of some unsound scholar, and have been incorporated by some
      transcriber into the text of his MS. copy, whence the error has spread. He

      the battle of Killicrankie, just before the fight began, "he (Sir Ewen)
      commanded such of the Camerons as were posted near him to make a great
      shout, which being seconded by those who stood on the right and left, ran
      quickly through the whole army, and was returned by the enemy. But the
      noise of the muskets and cannon, with the echoing of the hills, made the
      Highlanders fancy that their shouts were much louder and brisker than
      those of the enemy, and Lochiel cried out, 'Gentlemen, take courage, the
      day is ours: I am the oldest commander in the army, and have always
      observed something ominous and fatal in such a dull, hollow and feeble
      noise as the enemy made in their shout, which prognosticates that they are

      of peace, nine persons to be sacrificed. In whatever manner they immolated

      The former had kings, the latter chiefs. Both in kingdoms and republics,
      military affairs were under the conduct of the generals. The nations were
      divided into cantons; each of which was superintended by a chief, or
      count, who administered justice in it. The cantons were divided into
      districts or hundreds, so called because they contained a hundred vills or
      townships. In each hundred was a companion, or centenary, chosen from the
      people, before whom small causes were tried. Before the count, all causes,
      as well great as small, were amenable. The centenaries are called
      companions by Tacitus, after the custom of the Romans; among whom the

      suffer plunder from their own countrymen, which they know not how to bear

      because, when they have lost all their booty by the dice, they have no

      entirely cutting off the Teutonic nation." (Velleus Paterculus, ii. 12.)
      Livy says there were 200,000 slain, and 90,000 taken prisoners. The
      succeeding year he defeated the Cimbri, who had penetrated into Italy and
      crossed the Adige, in the Raudian plain, where now is Rubio, killing and
      taking prisoners upwards of 100,000 men. That he did not, however, obtain
      an unbought victory over this warlike people, may be conjectured from the
      resistance he met with even from their women. We are told by Florus (iii.
      3) that "he was obliged to sustain an engagement with their wives, as well
      as themselves; who, entrenching themselves on all sides with wagons and
      cars, fought from them, as from towers, with lances and poles. Their death
      was no less glorious than their resistance. For, when they could not
      obtain from Marius what they requested by an embassy, their liberty, and
      admission into the vestal priesthood (which, indeed, could not lawfully be
      granted); after strangling their infants, they either fell by mutual
      wounds, or hung themselves on trees or the poles of their carriages in

      and, favored by a mild sea climate, was overspread with vegetation and
      forest. This forest was the means of amber being produced. Certain trees
      in it exuded gums in such quantities that the sunken forest soil now
      appears to be filled with it to such a degree, as if it had only been
      deprived of a very trifling part of its contents by the later eruptions of
      the sea, and the countless storms which have lashed the ocean for
      centuries." Hence, though found underground, it appears to have been
      originally the production of some resinous tree. Hence, too, the reason of
      the appearance of insects, &amp;c. in it, as mentioned by Tacitus.]

      language. Scaurus was consul B.C. 114, and again B.C. 106. He is the same
      Scaurus whom Sallust mentions as having been bribed by Jugurtha. As the
      banishment of Rutilius took place on the accusation of Scaurus, it is
      possible that, when the former wrote his life, the latter also wrote his,
      in order to defend himself from charges advanced against him.]

    <p class="foot">
      2 (<a href="#linknoteref-1002">return</a>)<br /> [ <i>Venia opus fuit</i>.
      This whole passage has greatly perplexed the critics. The text is
      disputed, and it is not agreed why Tacitus asks indulgence. Brotier,
      Dronke, and others, say he asks indulgence for the inferiority of his
      style and manner <i>(incondita ac rudi voce</i>, c. 3), as compared with
      the distinguished authors (<i>quisque celeberrimus</i>) of an earlier and
      better age. But there would have been no less occasion to apologize for
      that, if the times he wrote of had not been so hostile to virtue. Hertel,
      La Bletterie, and many French critics, understand that he apologizes for
      writing the memoir of his father-in-law so late (<i>nunc</i>), when he was
      already dead (<i>defuncti</i>), instead of doing it, as the great men of a
      former day did, while the subject of their memoirs was yet alive; and he
      pleads, in justification of the delay, that he could not have written it
      earlier without encountering the dangers of that cruel age (the age of
      Domitian). This makes a very good sense. The only objection against it is,
      that the language, <i>opus fuit</i>, seems rather to imply that it was
      necessary to justify himself for writing it at all, by citing the examples
      of former distinguished writers of biography, as he had done in the
      foregoing introduction. But why would it have been unnecessary to
      apologize for writing the life of Agricola, if the times in which he lived
      had not been so unfriendly to virtue? Because then Agricola would have had
      opportunity to achieve victories and honors, which would have demanded
      narration, but for which the jealousy and cruelty of Domitian now gave no
      scope. This is the explanation of Roth; and he supports it by reference to
      the fact, that the achievements of Agricola in the conquest of Britain,
      though doubtless just as Tacitus has described them, yet occupy so small a
      space in general history, that they are not even mentioned by any ancient
      historian except Dio Cassius; and he mentions them chiefly out of regard
      to the discovery made by Agricola, for the first time, that Britain was an
      island (Vid. R. Exc. 1.) This explanation answers all the demands of
      grammar and logic; but as a matter of taste and feeling, I cannot receive
      it. Such an apology for the unworthiness of his subject at the
      commencement of the biography, ill accords with the tone of dignified
      confidence which pervades the memoir. The best commentary I have seen on
      the passage is that of Walther; and it would not, perhaps, be giving more
      space to so mooted a question than the scholar requires, to extract it
      entire:&mdash;"<i>Venia</i>," he says, "is here nothing else than what we,
      in the language of modesty, call an apology, and has respect to the very
      justification he has just offered in the foregoing exordium. For Tacitus
      there appeals to the usage, not of remote antiquity only, but of later
      times also, to justify his design of writing the biography of a
      distinguished man. There would have been no need of such an apology in
      other times. In other times, dispensing with all preamble, he would have
      begun, as in c. 4, 'Cnaeus Julius Agricola,' &amp;c., assured that no one
      would question the propriety of his course. But now, after a long and
      servile silence, when one begins again 'facta moresque posteris tradere,'
      when he utters the first word where speech and almost memory (c. 2) had so
      long been lost, when he stands forth as the first vindicator of condemned
      virtue, he seems to venture on something so new, so strange, so bold, that
      it may well require apology." In commenting upon <i>cursaturus&mdash;tempora</i>,
      Walther adds: "If there is any boldness in the author's use of words here,
      that very fact suits the connection, that by the complexion of his
      language even, he might paint the audacity 'cursandi tam saeva et infesta
      virtutibus tempora'&mdash;of running over (as in a race, for such is
      Walther's interpretation of <i>cursandi</i>) times so cruel and so hostile
      to virtue. Not that those times could excite in Tacitus any real personal
      fear, for they were past, and he could now think what he pleased, and
      speak what he thought (Hist. i. 1). Still he shudders at the recollection
      of those cruelties; and he treads with trembling footstep, as it were,
      even the path lately obstructed by them. He looks about him to see
      whether, even now, he may safely utter his voice, and he timidly asks
      pardon for venturing to break the reigning silence."&mdash;<i>Tyler</i>.]

      emperor deprived him of the military command of the troops in Africa in an
      insulting manner. Dion (lix.) states, that when, from his age and rank,
      Silanus was usually asked his opinion first in the senate, the emperor
      found a pretext for preventing this respect; being paid to MS worth.
      Suetonius (iv. 23) records that the emperor one day put to sea in a hasty

      indeed, is intercepted from the surface of the earth itself, and so there
      is darkness upon it; but that the sky above is still clear and bright from
      its rays. And hence he supposes that the brightness of the upper regions
      neutralizes the darkness on the earth, forming a degree of light
      equivalent to the evening twilight or the morning dawn, or, indeed,
      rendering it next to impossible to decide when the evening closes and the

      of fighting from <i>essedae</i>: They first drive round with them to all
      parts of the line, throwing their javelins, and generally disordering the
      ranks by the very alarm occasioned by the horses, and the rattling of the

      drivers then withdraw a little from the battle, in order that, if their
      friends are overpowered by numbers, they may have a secure retreat to the
      chariots. Thus they act with the celerity of horse, and the stability of
      foot; and by daily use and exercise they acquire the power of holding up
      their horses at full speed down a steep declivity, of stopping them
      suddenly, and turning in a short compass; and they accustom themselves to

      had relaxed their files to prevent their being out-fronted, now closed, in
      order better to resist the enemy, who by this means were unable to
      penetrate them. The chariots and horse, therefore, became entangled amidst
      the inequalities of the ground, and the thick ranks of the Romans; and, no
      longer able to wheel and career as upon the open plain, gave not the least

      unpitying, Like a weapon, of itself blind and unconscious, he was
      frequently hurled by Domitian against every man of worth." (iv. 22.)
      Juvenal launches the thunder of invective against him in the following
      lines:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Et cum mortifero prudens Vejento Catullo,
  Qui numquam visae flagrabat amore puellae,
  Grande, et conspicuum nostro quoque tempore monstrum,
  Caecus adulator, dirusque a ponte satelles,
  Dignus Aricinos qui mendicaret ad axes,
  Blandaque devexae jactaret basia rhedae.&mdash;Sat. iv. 113.

  "Cunning Vejento next, and by his side
  Bloody Catullus leaning on his guide:
  Decrepit, yet a furious lover he,
  And deeply smit with charms he could not see.
  A monster, that ev'n this worst age outvies,
  Conspicuous and above the common size.
  A blind base flatterer; from some bridge or gate,
  Raised to a murd'ring minister of state.
  Deserving still to beg upon the road,
  And bless each passing wagon and its load."&mdash;DUKE.]

      the numerous villanies of numerous persons, nothing appeared more
      atrocious than that in the senate-house one senator should lay hands on
      another, a praetorian on a consular man, a judge on a criminal."&mdash;B.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
